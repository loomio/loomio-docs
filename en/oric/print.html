<p><em>This guide is intended for corporations in the ORIC–Loomio pilot program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking help to use Loomio for good governance.</em></p>
<p>Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's <strong>context</strong> and set up a system and processes to serve its <strong>purpose</strong> and meet their <strong>obligations</strong> under the law.</p>
<p><em>“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”</em> That's a <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf">description of good governance</a> from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Open communication is at its heart.</p>
<p>You can use Loomio to strengthen governance: <strong>collaborate</strong> beyond board meetings, <strong>include everyone</strong> in open, honest and respectful discussion, and <strong>document everything</strong> as you go. Then when directors do come together at the same time, they can ratify all the key decisions.</p>
<p>Loomio—and this guide to using it—will help your board to <strong>communicate well</strong>, <strong>make good decisions</strong> and <strong>be accountable</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="within-this-guide"><a class="header" href="#within-this-guide">Within this guide</a></h2>
<p>This guide includes the following sections:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="key-concepts-oric.html">Loomio key concepts</a></li>
<li><a href="guide-directors.html">Guide for directors using Loomio</a></li>
<li><a href="guide-connectors.html">Guide for connectors managing Loomio for their corporation</a></li>
<li><a href="for-success.html">Setting up for success</a></li>
</ul>
<p>There are also some practical resources, as below.</p>
<h2 id="sandpit"><a class="header" href="#sandpit">Sandpit</a></h2>
<p>If you want to try out a Loomio group—start a thread, comment, create a proposal or poll—with no impact on your real Loomio group, you can <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">create a temporary demo group</a>. Think of it as a sandpit. Feel free to play around, respond to a thread or a poll, or create your own. Please don't worry about making a mess: your whole group will disappear after 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="templates"><a class="header" href="#templates">Templates</a></h2>
<p>When you create a demonstration group (as above, in the 'sandpit') you'll see examples of threads you might create in your real group for the board of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. </p>
<p>Loomio is also building a new feature that will support you in common tasks like preparing for a board meeting. When that feature goes live, you won't have to create a new thread from scratch. You'll be able to create a thread from a template.</p>

<p>Loomio is a collaborative working space, shaped for making decisions — to achieve outcomes in line with your purpose.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts"><a class="header" href="#key-concepts">Key concepts</a></h2>
<h3 id="group"><a class="header" href="#group">Group</a></h3>
<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for your organisation to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.</p>
<p><img src="Groups.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group home</strong></p>
<p>Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help members participate.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroups</strong></p>
<p>Subgroups are a space for a smaller subset of people to focus on a project or committee work.</p>
<p>Depending on the settings, the subgroup can be visible to the broader group, or for subgroup members' eyes only.</p>
<h3 id="thread"><a class="header" href="#thread">Thread</a></h3>
<p>Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.</p>
<p><img src="Threads.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>Threads are used for many purposes. In a board, you will use threads to prepare for a board meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on resolutions, approve minutes, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a consensus or at least a shared understanding of issues important to you.</p>
<p>Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organisation’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<h3 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h3>
<p>One of the best things about Loomio is its range of tools for gaining a clear view of where your group stands on any matter. Each tool has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. </p>
<p><img src="Proposals.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>proposal</strong> is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask group members to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree</li>
<li>abstain or </li>
<li>disagree. </li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone in the group has a chance to explain what prompted it. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. </p>
<p>As well as helping your group to convert discussions into outcomes, a proposal creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>
<h3 id="other-voting-tools"><a class="header" href="#other-voting-tools">Other voting tools</a></h3>
<p>A proposal is good for suggesting a particular path and gauging who wants to take it. But sometimes you might want group members to make a different kind of choice. </p>
<p>Loomio offers a range of other poll tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll</strong>: to ask people which option/s they approve</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'</li>
<li><strong>Time poll</strong>: to find the best time for the group to do something</li>
<li><strong>Score poll</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale</li>
<li><strong>Dot vote</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out</li>
<li><strong>Ranked choice</strong>: to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Use your own Loomio group or <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">create a demo group</a>. </p>

<p>Loomio is a private and secure service for your board to <strong>talk about matters, make decisions and keep track</strong> of everything. Using Loomio between meetings means that when you do meet in person, you can focus on what matters most.</p>
<p>This Loomio service is provided by the Office of Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC), to strengthen governance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Your group will be in the following ORIC domain: <strong><a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au">decisions.oric.gov.au</a></strong> &lt;&lt; <em>(bookmark that address in your browser)</em></p>
<p>Know that <strong>no one from ORIC has access</strong> to your group. It's private for your board members and whoever else you invite.</p>
<h2 id="minimum-requirements"><a class="header" href="#minimum-requirements">Minimum requirements</a></h2>
<p>Loomio works on standard hardware and software. There is no need to download any software or app but you do need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a computer, tablet or smartphone with a <strong>current browser</strong> (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari),</li>
<li>an <strong>email</strong> application (such as Outlook, Gmail, Protonmail)</li>
<li><strong>internet service</strong> via wifi (wireless network), ethernet (cable) or mobile data plan (3G or above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Old browsers such as Internet Explorer might not work.</p>
<p>If you have problems seeing Loomio on your device, please contact <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">Loomio Support</a> or email <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a>.</p>
<h2 id="on-this-page"><a class="header" href="#on-this-page">On this page</a></h2>
<p>Read on for how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>create your path in to Loomio</li>
<li>set how you present yourself</li>
<li>respond in a thread</li>
<li>vote on a proposal or in a poll</li>
</ul>
<p>We'll also share some:</p>
<ul>
<li>frequently asked questions (and answers)</li>
<li>common problems (and how to fix them)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="create-your-path-into-loomio"><a class="header" href="#create-your-path-into-loomio">Create your path into Loomio</a></h2>
<p>You will receive an <strong>email invitation</strong> to join your board's Loomio group. You don’t need a password, and your computer will remember you (if you let it).</p>
<p>In the middle of the email is a button to <strong>accept invitation</strong>. Use it! It will open a webpage where you can create an account on the service at decisions.oric.gov.au.</p>
<p>On that webpage you will see a button to <strong>CONTINUE WITH EMAIL</strong>. Use that button and you will land at a page to create your Loomio user account:</p>
<p><img src="create-account.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Type in your name, so people in your group will recognise you.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>CREATE ACCOUNT</strong> button, bottom-right. You will then have an account on <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au">decisions.oric.gov.au</a>. &lt;&lt; Bookmark that page in your browser, and/or create a shortcut on your phone. That way, next time you want to enter the Loomio group space, it's just a tap away.</p>
<h2 id="set-how-you-present-yourself"><a class="header" href="#set-how-you-present-yourself">Set how you present yourself</a></h2>
<p>You can add <strong>a picture of yourself</strong>, to display next to all the comments you make. That makes it easy for other directors to see who said what. </p>
<p>When you first join Loomio, it invites you to add a picture—or to instead use your initials (the first letters of your first and last names).</p>
<p><img src="set-profile-photo1.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>To add a photo to your profile, tap to <strong>upload new photo</strong>. Browse to a suitable photo file from your computer. (It will show up small, so a photo of your face is best.)</p>

<p>Once you select the photo you want, use the button marked <strong>open</strong> to upload it. You can always change it later.</p>
<p>You might want to add more detail to your profile, especially if you don't know your other board members very well. At the top left of your screen you'll see your photo or initials. Tap there, and select <strong>edit profile</strong>. </p>
<p>Here, you can <strong>introduce yourself</strong>, your expertise, interests, affiliations. You can also add your <strong>location</strong>. There's a field to set your language, but sadly, Loomio is not yet translated into any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander languages :(</p>
<h2 id="threads-comments-and-other-responses"><a class="header" href="#threads-comments-and-other-responses">Threads, comments and other responses</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>thread</strong> is where your board will discuss corporation concerns and make governance decisions. Your group page will list each thread, like this:</p>
<p><img src="thread-list-a.png#width-40" alt="" /></p>
<p>Tap on a thread to open it, and scroll down the thread to read other people's comments. You'll reach a place where you can write your own.</p>
<p>Make sure that the <strong>comment</strong> tab is highlighted and write in the space alongside your profile image. There are buttons below that space to add documents, images, links—and to format your words (make a heading, bold or italic, list items, and so on).</p>
<p>When you are ready, use the button to <strong>POST COMMENT</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="comment.png#width-40" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you see something you want to change, you can <strong>edit</strong> your comment. To do that, tap the small pencil icon at the bottom-right of a comment.</p>
<h2 id="voting-in-a-poll"><a class="header" href="#voting-in-a-poll">Voting in a poll</a></h2>
<p>Polls help groups to make decisions. Your board will probably use polls to:</p>
<ul>
<li>approve minutes</li>
<li>pass resolutions and </li>
<li>find times to meet.</li>
</ul>
<p>When someone adds a poll, it appears in the mini-navigation in the right-hand sidebar of the thread.</p>
<p>Here is an example of a poll:</p>
<p><img src="invitation-to-vote.png#width-40" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>To vote</strong></p>
<p>Tap on the icon that best matches your response. You can also leave a reason or comment about why you chose that option.</p>
<p>Then <strong>SUBMIT VOTE</strong></p>

<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-from-people-new-to-loomio"><a class="header" href="#frequently-asked-questions-from-people-new-to-loomio">Frequently asked questions from people new to Loomio</a></h2>
<p><strong>Q. Who sent the invitation or notification email?</strong></p>
<p>A. The email was sent by someone you know, likely the chair of your board, or CEO or administrator of your corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Is it safe?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, you have been invited to a private online space set up specifically for your board.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How can I know it is safe?</strong></p>
<p>A. Here are some checks you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you recognise the name of the person who has invited you?</li>
<li>Do you recognise the name of your corporation?</li>
<li>Were you expecting an invitation?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answers are all yes, it is most likely a valid message.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I have to sign in every time I use Loomio?</strong></p>
<p>A. If this is your computer, it should 'remember' you and keep you signed in to Loomio. However, you will need to sign in again if you reset your computer or use Loomio on a different computer or phone.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I need a password?</strong></p>
<p>A. No, you don’t need a password, but you can use one if you prefer. If you have trouble receiving email, it's a good idea to set up a password to access your Loomio group.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p><strong>Problem: I can’t receive email</strong></p>
<p>Solution: Your Loomio user account is linked to your preferred email address.  If you cannot access your email, you will need to sign into Loomio with a password.</p>
<p>If you need a password set up to access Loomio, contact <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact">Loomio support</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem: I need my invitation to Loomio sent as a text message to my phone</strong></p>
<p>Solution: Contact Loomio support so we can generate an SMS text for you. It will look something like:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Hi, this is Michael from Loomio. Use the link below to reach your board's page on Loomio. Follow the instructions to set up your user account and tap ‘Sign in via email’. Any problems, just reply to this text. Thanks!</em></p>

<p>Good communication today requires Directors to be able to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet; capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, viewing videos and reading electronic documents.</p>
<p>Success of using an online tool like Loomio to communicate with your board requires Directors to be familiar with basic apps such as email, internet browser, document and video viewers.</p>
<p>Here is a quick check list to review with each Director:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date computer or smart phone with email, internet browser and video viewer</li>
<li>Connection to the internet via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Know how to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Send/Receive email, browse the internet and open links to go to web pages</li>
<li>If Director is not comfortable using their computer or smart phone, is there a person in the organisation, friend of family member who can help them with these things?</li>
</ul>
<p>Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old unsupported browsers are not supported, such as Microsoft Internet Explorer.</p>

<p>You can remind people you have invited with <strong>Resend invitation</strong>, give anyone administrator level access with <strong>Make admin</strong> and add a person’s title with <strong>Set title</strong> such as Chairperson.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><img src="members-tab.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="invite-people"><a class="header" href="#invite-people">Invite people</a></h2>
<p>You can invite people to join the Loomio group either by sending a message to their email address via Loomio, or <strong>Share</strong> an invitation link via your email service or in a newsletter.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click <strong>Invite</strong></li>
<li>Type or copy/paste the email addresses of the directors you want to invite</li>
</ul>
<p>You can add an optional message to encourage people to click the invitation button:</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><em>Hi, please join our private Loomio group. We use this space to notify directors of meetings, prepare and vote on resolutions, discuss topics between meetings, and to record decisions in a searchable archive.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>: If you have a lot of people to invite, you can copy up to 100 email addresses at a time from a list, such as from a spreadsheet column.</em></p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><img src="invite-people.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="4-start-a-first-thread"><a class="header" href="#4-start-a-first-thread">4. Start a first thread</a></h1>
<p>Start a thread to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We can use this thread to introduce Loomio to directors, and invite them to post a comment.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: Let’s get each director to post a comment so we know that directors are connected.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Threads</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>New Thread</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ednBbOD.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Thread</strong></p>
<p>Threads are where your group can discuss a topic, exchange information and make decisions together. Threads keep everything about a topic in the same place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your group’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>: Use a Loomio thread instead of writing an email.</em></p>
<p><em>All the information, discussion and replies are in one place, where you can see who has read the thread, and nudge people if needed; avoiding email chain confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Group</strong> - Select the group or subgroup you want to post the thread in. When started, your thread will be visible to the members of your group or subgroup.</p>
<p>You can also select <strong>Invite-only thread (no group)</strong> if you want to have a private discussion with one or more people, or if you want to draft a thread before posting in your group.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - Give your thread a title; this is usually announcing a topic or asking a question. Keep it short and to the point.  A thread title is like the subject line in an email.</p>
<p><strong>Notify</strong> - You can choose to notify people by sending them an email of the thread via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.</li>
<li>Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tag</strong> - Choose a tag for your thread to make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic, or create a new tag.</p>

<h1 id="5-start-a-first-poll"><a class="header" href="#5-start-a-first-poll">5. Start a first Poll</a></h1>
<p>Let’s start a poll to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We use Polls and Proposal to make decisions and request a response.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: Let's get everyone to vote in a poll, so they're ready when we get to work.</strong></p>
<p>You start a <strong>Poll</strong> or <strong>Proposal</strong> from within a Thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the thread that you wish to start your poll and click on the <strong>Poll</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the type of poll you want to use. Let’s start with <strong>Check</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vq5DB6A.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Start Check</strong></p>
<p>A check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.</p>
<p>Use it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: <em>&quot;I'm coming to the event&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;I'll join the subcommittee&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;I have completed my actions&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>A day before the check closes, Loomio will remind people who have not participated.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - Give your poll a title. Keep it short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> - Select a tag that will help people easily find this poll when searching.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong> - Explain what you are asking people to do and how to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong> - Select the poll voting options.  Each poll type provides different options.</p>
<p><strong>Closing date and time</strong> - Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong> - 24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is <strong>Undecided voters</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who can vote?</strong> - You can decide who is voting; anyone in your group or only the people you specifically invite.</p>
<p>The default settings is everyone in the group can see who has voted. However you can select anonymous voting if you want to keep the identity of voters secret. </p>
<p>*<strong>Tip</strong>: Anonymous voting is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.</p>
<p><strong>Check poll suggestion</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SpLVTMc.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Invite to vote</strong> - You can choose to invite people by sending them an email of the poll via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.</li>
<li>Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>
<p>Here is what people will see when responding to a Poll request to vote:</p>

<h1 id="6-subgroups"><a class="header" href="#6-subgroups">6. Subgroups</a></h1>
<p>Do you need a subgroup? Subgroups help you organize the work of particular groups of people; for example a subcommittee, working group or project team. You may also set up a subgroup for communicating with membership.</p>
<p>Subgroups work just like groups and are located within your &quot;parent&quot; group or organization.</p>
<p>Most of the features and settings are the same as in your parent group, and include the ability to allow members of the parent group to see, but not participate in, threads and polls in the subgroup. This is helpful if you want to offer transparency of discussions and decisions to members of the parent group.</p>
<p>A person can be a member of your subgroup and not of your parent group.</p>
<p>Typical subgroups for Indigenous Corporations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial subcommittee</li>
<li>Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Risks &amp; Audits</li>
<li>Industry-specific subgroup such as Property</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="board-subgroups.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="set-up-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#set-up-a-subgroup">Set up a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Subgroups</strong> tab and click <strong>New Subgroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Follow a similar process as in <a href="guide-connectors.html#1-set-up-your-board-on-loomio">Step 1</a> to set up your subgroup.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/loeydDj.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>To allow members of your parent group see threads in the subgroup:</p>
<p>On your subgroup home page, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click <strong>Edit group settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Change permissions by ticking or un-ticking the check box.</p>

<h1 id="why-loomio"><a class="header" href="#why-loomio">Why Loomio?</a></h1>
<p>Loomio is an online place for the board to have discussions and make decisions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessible, transparent and inclusive; stay connected wherever you have internet access</li>
<li>Build consensus</li>
<li>A safe place for all communications, information, deliberations, decisions and records of the the board</li>
<li>Prepare for meetings and follow up with minutes and actions</li>
</ul>
<p>Push admin tasks onto Loomio to free up meeting time for discussions that matter:</p>
<ul>
<li>Arrive at meetings prepared and in context</li>
<li>Push topics that require further discussion and info back into Loomio</li>
<li>Record minutes and progress actions</li>
</ul>
<p>It is an opportunity to align and integrate your governance and cultural practices with Loomio.</p>

<p><em>This page will help your board make best use of Loomio's platform and tools.</em></p>
<p>Adopting Loomio will take <strong>conscious effort</strong>. It means a <strong>new way of working</strong>—as a whole board and as individual directors. </p>
<p>Using Loomio can save you time and improve your decisions and your accountability. But to reap those rewards, the first step is to agree on how to make best use of the platform and the tools. 'Best use' is not universal; it depends on the circumstances of your corporation and your directors. </p>

<h2 id="what-structure-suits-our-board"><a class="header" href="#what-structure-suits-our-board">What structure suits our board?</a></h2>
<p>A Loomio group comprises a 'parent group' and any number of 'subgroups'. </p>
<p>Subgroups are separate from the parent group but connected to it, and they work just like groups. Subgroups help focus and contain the work of particular groups of people, such as a committee, council or project team. </p>
<p>You can keep a subgroup private, so that parent group members can't see anything in it. But maybe you want the subgroup to be readily accountable to the parent group. If so, you can set it so members of the parent group can see (but not respond to) threads and polls in the subgroup. </p>
<p>As an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, and depending on your size, you might have a subgroup for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a finance committee</li>
<li>a health &amp; safety committee</li>
<li>a risk &amp; audit committee</li>
<li>industry-specific tasks, such as managing property</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, you can add outsiders to a subgroup—such as a lawyer or accountant or staff-member.</p>
<p>You could even set up <strong>a subgroup for all your members</strong>—so as directors you can share information and engage with the broader membership. </p>

<p>There may be times when it would be useful to involve someone from outside the corporation in a particular discussion. As noted, an external person can be part of a subgroup. In any one thread of the main (parent) group, you can also invite an outsider in—to see and respond. At the top of every thread is a button to 'invite'. When you hit it, you can add an email address. </p>
<p>You might want some protocols for inviting external people. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need the board to approve, before you send an invitation—or at least the chair? </li>
<li>Or do you agree as a board that any one of you can use your discretion to invite someone in as you see fit? </li>
<li>Will you want to remove the extra person after a certain time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Below we describe how you could perform typical governance tasks in Loomio.</p>
<ol>
<li>You might use a Loomio thread to take strategic action <strong>between board meetings</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<table><thead><tr><th>Between-meetings work</th><th>Loomio tools</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Start thinking</strong> about the next board meeting</td><td><strong>New thread</strong>—Give it a <strong>title</strong> that will make sense to everyone, and add some notes about the <strong>context</strong> for the thread, eg: thinking about the next phase of our governance work</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Agree on a focus</strong> for the next meeting</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—What's the most important focus for our next meeting? Either suggest something, or invite responses to the open question. You might reach general agreement through discussion. Or you could use a <strong>proposal</strong> or <strong>poll</strong> to clarify and settle on a priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Check progress on <strong>actions arising</strong> from the last meeting</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—use a <strong>checklist</strong> to post a list of tasks and who they were assigned to, and ask each person to check them off and/or comment. Note: later, when you have a thread to announce the meeting, you might <strong>move this comment</strong> there—the replies will go with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Share</strong> information and ideas to consider in relation to the strategic or business plan</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—introduce a report or other material relevant to the strategy or operations, and invite responses. You can <strong>attach a file</strong> or <strong>link</strong> to a published document.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol start="2">
<li>When it's time to <strong>get organised for the next meeting</strong>, set up a new thread dedicated to preparing for it:</li>
</ol>
<table><thead><tr><th>Announcing the next meeting</th><th>Loomio tools</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Notice</strong> of meeting</td><td>Create a <strong>new thread</strong>. In its <strong>context</strong>, note the date, time and place for the scheduled meeting. You can edit these details if the meeting is moved.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Post the <strong>agenda</strong></td><td>In a <strong>new comment</strong>, list all items on the agenda.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Focus discussion</strong> on a particular agenda item</td><td>Add a <strong>new comment</strong> to elaborate on an agenda item and focus discussion on it. To ensure it's easy to find this conversation in the thread, <strong>pin it</strong> to the <strong>timeline</strong> (the mini-navigation in the sidebar on the right)</td></tr>
<tr><td>Ask the board to accept the <strong>minutes</strong> of the last meeting.</td><td>Add a <strong>check</strong> (yes/no poll) so directors can either approve the minutes or note corrections. Proposals and polls of all kinds are automatically included in the sidebar navigation ('timeline').</td></tr>
<tr><td>Add any proposed <strong>resolutions</strong></td><td>If the agenda includes voting on a resolution, add a <strong>proposal</strong> with the wording and options for responding.</td></tr>
<tr><td>As they become available, add financial <strong>reports</strong> and other board papers</td><td>A <strong>new comment</strong> can introduce financial and other reports and invite discussion. Or you could get straight to the point and add the reports through a <strong>poll or proposal</strong> and ask directors to review the accounts and either accept or question them.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Set a <strong>new date for the meeting</strong></td><td>If you need to postpone, you can use a <strong>time poll</strong> to suggest a few possible options and invite everyone to mark which dates are doable for them. The result will show the best time/s to meet.</td></tr>

<p>Because Loomio discussions and decisions are always already documented, it provides a robust way to verify all your board's decision-making. You can easily demonstrate what was decided, and when. If directors have discussed and commented, as well as voted on a resolution—you will also know how and why each decision was reached. </p>
<p>A resolution passed in between meetings is valid if (and only if) <em>all</em> eligible directors agree on it. You can ratify (formally approve) the decision at the next board meeting. That way, the decision will also appear in the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p>If you have less than 100% agreement, or if some directors have not voted, you will need to take the resolution to your next board meeting (whether online or in person). Then, you can use quorum and majority rules to ratify (or alter) the decision. The Loomio record will give you a good sense of any issues with the proposed resolution. So it shouldn't take long to resolve the matter one way or the other.</p>

<h2 id="how-quickly-do-we-expect-each-other-to-respond"><a class="header" href="#how-quickly-do-we-expect-each-other-to-respond">How quickly do we expect each other to respond?</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is like email in that you can respond at a time that suits you. But everyone has different work habits, and if some people taking much longer than others to respond, it can frustrate people and hinder progress.</p>
<p>Quick responses are great because they keep things moving. On the other hand, people need time to access, read and digest the information—especially when it's a complex or important matter.</p>
<p>It's up to your group to <strong>consider what's a reasonable response time</strong> in your circumstances. It's important to discuss it as a board, and reach an agreement. Then, if someone is continually non-responsive, at the next meeting you can refer back to the agreement and ask that director and everyone else how the board should handle the issue. </p>
<p>There are also tools in Loomio to prompt people to respond. If the issue is that someone has not contributed to an important discussion, you might post a poll or a proposal to alert everyone that now is the time to have their say. When you post a proposal or poll, you can set how long it stays open. You can also use a comment to remind people to respond, and if you want to notify a particular person of a comment, you can @mention them by name.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-notify-people-of-group-activity"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-notify-people-of-group-activity">When should we notify people of group activity?</a></h2>
<p>In Loomio, <strong>notifying means sending an email</strong>. So to avoid overloading your directors' inboxes, it's best to notify only when something important is happening, or if you really need to get the board's attention.</p>
<p>There are many places within Loomio that you can notify people including when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>invite people to a thread</li>
<li>invite people to respond to a poll or proposal</li>
<li>@mention a specific person within a comment</li>
</ul>
<p>When you post a thread to notify directors about the next meeting, it may include several polls and proposals. Rather than sending a notification for each one, it is better to notify people once, about the thread, and ask them to read through, comment and vote in any polls or proposals.</p>
<p>As a board you might consider what works for you, and establish a protocol, so you receive the notifications you need and avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-start-a-new-thread"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-start-a-new-thread">When should we start a new thread?</a></h2>
<p>If you're wondering whether to start a new thread, ask yourself: would a new thread make it easier to manage the discussion? If you're still talking about the same topic, it makes sense to allow a thread to keep growing. At some point it might become too long to be easy to navigate. In that case, you might find a natural break and start a new thread. For example, if you have a thread for budget planning, you probably want to limit it to planning for a specific year. </p>
<p>When a thread is no longer active, or no longer relevant to the current discussion, you can <strong>close it</strong>. The thread will still be there, but you'll have to <strong>view closed threads</strong> to see it.</p>
<p>If the discussion in a thread veers off to a new topic, and that topic needs further discussion, start a new thread. </p>
<p>In the new thread, you can add links to the old thread and/or to specific comments in another thread.</p>
<p>There are tools within Loomio that enable you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy a link to a thread or a comment, or </li>
<li>move a comment to another thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it's up to your board to consider how to manage your discussions so you can more easily navigate and participate. You might want to set up protocols for:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting a new thread: can any director start a thread or only the connector/s? Are there conventions to use when adding a title and context?</li>
<li>closing a thread: can any director close a thread or only the connector/s? </li>
<li>will the connector do occasional housekeeping to keep threads tidy and easy to navigate?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-know-what-kind-of-poll-to-use"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-know-what-kind-of-poll-to-use">How do we know what kind of poll to use?</a></h2>
<p>Loomio offers various kinds of poll. They are useful in a wide range of circumstances, and sometimes there's no clear-cut reason for using one over another. </p>
<p>For your governance work you will likely use the first 3 the most. </p>
<h3 id="check"><a class="header" href="#check">Check</a></h3>
<p>A check poll has only 2 responses: a tick (✔) for 'yes' and a cross (✘) for 'no'. You might use a check poll to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if directors are ready for the next board meeting. It's good to know that people are prepared, and important to know if someone is missing some important information.</li>
<li>Check if directors approve the minues of the last meeting. You can attach a file to the poll (e.g. 'Minutes.doc') and anyone who responds with a ✘ can add a comment to identify something that needs correcting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Can we add small images linked to full-size? (So they're not overwhelming): check-poll-setup.gif and check-poll-view.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="poll"><a class="header" href="#poll">Poll</a></h3>
<p>A simple poll is good for when there are several options and you can only choose one. For example, you might use it to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>where to hold your next in-person meeting</li>
<li>which of 3 quotes to accept </li>
<li>who to give an award to</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set it to be single-choice or multiple-choice. </p>
<p><em>Insert simple-poll-setup.gif and simple-poll-view.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="time"><a class="header" href="#time">Time</a></h3>
<p>Use a time poll to find the best time to meet. Provide a few different options. Everyone marks each time with good, doable or bad. Then, Loomio shows you the best time. From there, you can send a calendar invitation to all your board members.</p>
<p><em>Insert time-poll-illustration.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="dot"><a class="header" href="#dot">Dot</a></h3>
<p>A dot vote could be useful if you want to know, for example, which 3 out of 7 possible options people most want. A person can put all 3 eggs in one basket (if they're really keen on that option and otherwise don't mind) or allocate one vote each to 3 different options.</p>
<h3 id="score"><a class="header" href="#score">Score</a></h3>
<p>A score poll might be useful in <strong>shortlisting candidates</strong> for a job.</p>
<h3 id="ranked-choice"><a class="header" href="#ranked-choice">Ranked choice</a></h3>
<p>A ranked choice poll is good when there are many options and you want people to choose a few and put them in order of preference. You might use it for an election where there are, say, 100 voters, 10 candidates and only 3 positions. It could be a good way to enable your members <strong>to elect the next board of directors</strong>?</p>

<h2 id="when-should-we-use-a-proposal-instead-of-a-poll"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-use-a-proposal-instead-of-a-poll">When should we use a proposal instead of a poll?</a></h2>
<p>Proposals are best when there's only one option on the table. For example, you might use a proposal to agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>to lodge a funding application</li>
<li>on the new terms of a lease</li>
<li>to approve the annual financial statements</li>
<li>to form a subcommittee</li>
<li>to put a special resolution to members</li>
<li>on a shift in strategic direction</li>
<li>to invite a guest to a board meeting</li>
<li>to recruit the preferred candidate for CEO </li>
<li>to accept an insurance quotation</li>
</ul>
