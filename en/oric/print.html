<p><em>This guide was made for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations in the ORIC–Loomio ‘connected governance’ program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking to use Loomio for good governance.</em></p>
<h2 id="background--introduction"><a class="header" href="#background--introduction">Background &amp; introduction</a></h2>
<p>Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's <strong>context</strong> and set up a system and processes to serve its <strong>purpose</strong> and meet their <strong>obligations</strong> under the law.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”</em> 
<a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf">United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>Open communication</strong> is at its heart.</p>
<h3 id="office-of-the-registrar-of-indigenous-corporations-oric"><a class="header" href="#office-of-the-registrar-of-indigenous-corporations-oric">Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC)</a></h3>
<p>Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC) knows that boards of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations face various <strong>challenges</strong>. The following are just some examples.</p>
<ul>
<li>Directors live in different places—and they’re busy people—so it’s difficult to arrange to meet regularly in person.</li>
<li>Some corporations deal with a high volume of transactional business (such as approvals for land use and financial transactions).</li>
<li>Corporations’ governance frameworks and practices may still be forming.</li>
<li>In many remote locations around Australia, internet service is poor.</li>
<li>Some directors are unfamiliar with online technology, and/or have low literacy.</li>
<li>The legacy of historical dispossession, separation and loss means that some corporations struggle with long-standing internal conflicts.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is ORIC’s role to support corporations to govern in accordance with:</p>
<ul>
<li>the CATSI Act</li>
<li>your rule book and</li>
<li>your cultural obligations.
With all those challenges in mind, we looked around for a tool and service that goes farthest to meet the complex needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations—and we found Loomio.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="loomio"><a class="header" href="#loomio">Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Loomio is a New Zealand-based cooperative. It offers a collaborative online working space for groups to make decisions. </p>
<div class="iframe-container">

</div>
<p>Loomio offers a chance to strengthen governance by enabling your board to:</p>
<ul>
<li>extend collaboration beyond board meetings</li>
<li>include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion</li>
<li>document everything as it happens.</li>
</ul>
<p>We want to set you up for success, not only in using the tools, but to govern well and achieve the objectives of your corporation. We hope that Loomio—and this guide to using it—will help your board to:</p>
<ul>
<li>communicate well</li>
<li>make good decisions and</li>
<li>be accountable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="within-this-guide"><a class="header" href="#within-this-guide">Within this guide</a></h2>

<p>There are also some practical resources, as below.</p>
<h2 id="sandpit"><a class="header" href="#sandpit">Sandpit</a></h2>
<p>If you want to try out a Loomio group—start a thread, comment, create a proposal or poll—with no impact on your real Loomio group, you can <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">create a temporary demo group</a>. Think of it as a sandpit. Feel free to play around, respond to a thread or a poll, or create your own. Please don't worry about making a mess: your whole group will disappear after 24 hours.</p>
<h2 id="templates"><a class="header" href="#templates">Templates</a></h2>
<p>When you create a demonstration group (as above, in the 'sandpit') you'll see examples of threads you might create in your real group for the board of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. </p>
<p>Loomio is also building a new feature that will support you in common tasks like preparing for a board meeting. When that feature goes live, you won't have to create a new thread from scratch. You'll be able to create a thread from a template.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts"><a class="header" href="#key-concepts">Key concepts</a></h2>
<h3 id="group"><a class="header" href="#group">Group</a></h3>
<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for your organisation to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.</p>
<p><img src="Groups.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group home</strong></p>
<p>Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help members participate.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroups</strong></p>
<p>A subgroup is a space for a smaller subset of people to focus on a project or committee work.</p>
<p>Depending on the settings, the subgroup can be visible to the broader group, or for subgroup members' eyes only.</p>
<p><em><strong>For more on subgroups see <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/oric/for-success.html#what-structure-suits-our-board">&quot;Setting up for success: What structure suits our board?&quot;</a></strong></em></p>
<h3 id="thread"><a class="header" href="#thread">Thread</a></h3>
<p>Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.</p>
<p><img src="Threads.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Threads keep conversations in line, showing you who said what, when.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Threads are used for many purposes. In a board, you will use threads to prepare for a board meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on resolutions, approve minutes, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a consensus or at least a shared understanding of issues important to you.</p>
<p>Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organisation’s discussions and decisions. You can see who has read the thread, and nudge people if needed. A threaded conversation is far less confusing to read than a series of emails from multiple people.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>Everything in Loomio happens within a thread, so other sections of this guide talk more about threads.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h3>
<p>One of the best things about Loomio is its range of tools for gaining a clear view of where your group stands on any matter. Each tool has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. </p>
<p><img src="Proposals.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>To funnel a discussion into a decision, or to gauge your board's response to a new idea, make a proposal.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>A proposal can <strong>convert a wide-ranging discussion into a clear, practical outcome</strong>. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. </p>
<p>For example, you might ask group members to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree</li>
<li>abstain or </li>
<li>disagree. </li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone in the group has a chance to explain what prompted their response. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. </p>
<p>As well as helping your group to convert discussions into outcomes, <strong>a proposal forms a record</strong> of how the decision came about.</p>
<h3 id="other-voting-tools"><a class="header" href="#other-voting-tools">Other voting tools</a></h3>
<p>A proposal is good for suggesting a particular path and gauging who wants to take it. But sometimes you might want group members to make a different kind of choice. </p>
<p>Loomio offers a range of other poll tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll</strong>: to ask people which option/s they approve</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'</li>
<li><strong>Time poll</strong>: to find the best time for the group to do something</li>
<li><strong>Score poll</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale</li>
<li><strong>Dot vote</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out</li>
<li><strong>Ranked choice</strong>: to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Either use your own Loomio group, or create a demo group at <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">decisions.oric.gov.au/try</a>. </p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-directors"><a class="header" href="#for-directors">For directors</a></h1>
<p>Loomio is a private and secure service for your board to <strong>talk about matters, make decisions and keep track</strong> of everything. Using Loomio between meetings means that when you do meet in person, you can focus on what matters most.</p>
<p>This Loomio service is provided by the Office of Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC), to strengthen governance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Your group will be in the following ORIC domain: <strong><a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au">decisions.oric.gov.au</a></strong> &lt;&lt; <em>(bookmark that address in your browser and/or <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/getting_started/sign-in.html#add-loomio-to-your-smartphone-home-screen">create a shortcut on your phone</a>)</em></p>
<p>Know that <strong>no one from ORIC has access</strong> to your group. It's private for your board members and whoever else you invite.</p>
<h2 id="requirements"><a class="header" href="#requirements">Requirements</a></h2>
<p>Loomio works on standard hardware and software. There is no need to download any software or app but you do need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a computer, tablet or smartphone with a <strong>current browser</strong> (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari),</li>
<li>an <strong>email</strong> application (such as Outlook, Gmail, Protonmail)</li>
<li><strong>internet service</strong> via wifi (wireless network), ethernet (cable) or mobile data plan (3G or above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Old browsers such as Internet Explorer might not work.</p>
<p>If you have problems seeing Loomio on your device, please contact <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact">Loomio Support</a> or email <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="in-this-section"><a class="header" href="#in-this-section">In this section</a></h2>

<p>We'll also share some:</p>
<ul>
<li>frequently asked questions (and answers)</li>
<li>common problems (and how to fix them)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-path-into-loomio"><a class="header" href="#your-path-into-loomio">Your path into Loomio</a></h2>
<p>You will receive an <strong>email invitation</strong> to join your board's Loomio group. You don’t need a password, and your computer will remember you (if you let it).</p>
<p>In the middle of the email is a button to <strong>accept invitation</strong>. Use it! It will open a webpage where you can create an account on the service at decisions.oric.gov.au.</p>
<p>On that webpage you will see a button to <strong>CONTINUE WITH EMAIL</strong>. Use that button and you will land at a page to create your Loomio user account:</p>
<p><img src="create-account.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Type in your name, so people in your group will recognise you.</p>
<p>Use the <strong>CREATE ACCOUNT</strong> button, bottom-right. You will then have an account on <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au">decisions.oric.gov.au</a>. </p>
<h2 id="your-profile-in-loomio"><a class="header" href="#your-profile-in-loomio">Your profile in Loomio</a></h2>
<p>You can add <strong>a picture of yourself</strong>, to display next to all the comments you make. That makes it easy for other directors to see who said what. </p>
<p>When you first join Loomio, it invites you to add a picture—or to instead use your initials (the first letters of your first and last names).</p>

<p>Once you select the photo you want, use the button marked <strong>open</strong> to upload it. You can always change it later.</p>
<p>You might want to add more detail to your profile, especially if you don't know your other board members very well. At the top left of your screen you'll see your photo or initials. Tap there, and select <strong>edit profile</strong>. </p>
<p>Here, you can <strong>introduce yourself</strong>, your expertise, interests, affiliations. You can also add your <strong>location</strong>. There's a field to set your language, but sadly, Loomio is not yet translated into any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander languages.</p>

<h2 id="threads-comments-and-other-responses"><a class="header" href="#threads-comments-and-other-responses">Threads, comments and other responses</a></h2>
<p>A <strong>thread</strong> is where your board will discuss corporation concerns and make governance decisions. Your group page will list each thread, like this:</p>
<p><img src="thread-list-a.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Tap on a thread to open it, and scroll down the thread to read other people's comments. You'll reach a place where you can write your own.</p>
<p>Make sure that the <strong>comment</strong> tab is highlighted and write in the space alongside your profile image. There are buttons below that space to add documents, images, links—and to format your words (make a heading, bold or italic, list items, and so on).</p>
<p>When you are ready, use the button to <strong>POST COMMENT</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="comment.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you see something you want to change, you can <strong>edit</strong> your comment. To do that, tap the small pencil icon at the bottom-right of a comment.</p>
<h2 id="polls-and-voting"><a class="header" href="#polls-and-voting">Polls and voting</a></h2>
<p>Polls help directors make decisions as a whole board. They are useful for administrative tasks like finding a time to meet, and approving minutes (or surfacing errors in them). You can also use a poll for deeper matters, such as to gauge what everyone thinks about something, or to pass a resolution.</p>
<p>Your board will probably use polls to:</p>
<ul>
<li>approve minutes</li>
<li>pass resolutions and </li>
<li>find times to meet.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is an example of a poll:</p>
<p><img src="invitation-to-vote.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>
<p>Tap on the icon that best matches your response. You can also leave a reason or comment about why you chose that option.</p>
<p>Then <strong>SUBMIT VOTE</strong></p>
<p><img src="vote-form.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you vote, there is an option to add a comment about why you made that choice.</p>
<p>Depending on how the poll has been set up, you can either see the results instantly, or when the poll has closed. By default, you’ll see who voted which way.
But polls can also be set to anonymous.</p>
<p>If you make a proposal and it fails to pass muster, you’ll have a good sense of why, so you’ll know how to adjust it to gain more support.</p>
<p><strong>Timeline</strong></p>
<p>When someone adds a poll, it appears in the ‘timeline’ (navigation tool) in the right-hand sidebar. Each item in the timeline is a link so you can jump directly to that part of the thread.</p>
<p>You can also manually ‘pin’ any post to the timeline. (Note that you cannot pin a reply.) Use the three dots at the bottom-right of a post and select <strong>Pin to timeline</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="frequently-asked-questions-from-people-new-to-loomio"><a class="header" href="#frequently-asked-questions-from-people-new-to-loomio">Frequently asked questions from people new to Loomio</a></h2>
<p><strong>Q. Who sent the invitation or notification email?</strong></p>
<p>A. The email was sent by someone you know, likely the chair of your board, or CEO or administrator of your corporation.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Is it safe?</strong></p>
<p>A. Yes, you have been invited to a private online space set up specifically for your board.</p>
<p><strong>Q. How can I know it is safe?</strong></p>
<p>A. Here are some checks you can do:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you recognise the name of the person who has invited you?</li>
<li>Do you recognise the name of your corporation?</li>
<li>Were you expecting an invitation?</li>
</ul>
<p>If your answers are all yes, it is most likely a valid message.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I have to sign in every time I use Loomio?</strong></p>
<p>A. If this is your computer, it should 'remember' you and keep you signed in to Loomio. However, you will need to sign in again if you reset your computer or use Loomio on a different computer or phone.</p>
<p><strong>Q. Do I need a password?</strong></p>
<p>A. No, you don’t need a password, but you can use one if you prefer. If you have trouble receiving email, it's a good idea to set up a password to access your Loomio group.</p>
<h2 id="troubleshooting"><a class="header" href="#troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</a></h2>
<p><strong>Problem: I can’t receive email</strong></p>
<p>Your Loomio user account is linked to your preferred email address.  If you cannot access your email, you will need to sign into Loomio with a password.</p>
<p>If you need a password set up to access Loomio, contact <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact">Loomio support</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Problem: I need my invitation to Loomio sent as a text message to my phone</strong></p>
<p>Contact <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact">Loomio support</a> so we can generate an SMS text for you. It will look something like:</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="for-connectors"><a class="header" href="#for-connectors">For connectors</a></h1>
<p>‘Connectors’ have special access and responsibilities in Loomio. Typically, a corporation’s connector is the person who provides administrative support to the board of directors.</p>
<p>Your connector’s primary objective is to <strong>set up your Loomio group to work for your circumstances</strong>. Your connector will also <em><strong>connect</strong></em> and exchange information—with:</p>
<ul>
<li>all the <strong>directors</strong> on their board—to ensure they can access and use the tools</li>
<li>other corporations’ <strong>connectors</strong>—for comparing notes on using Loomio</li>
<li><strong>Loomio</strong>—for technical support</li>
<li><strong>ORIC</strong>—for any discussion of the ORIC–Loomio ‘Connected Governance’ project.</li>
</ul>
<p>This part of the guide firstly invites you to assess how well-prepared your directors are for connected governance. Then it describes 6 concrete steps you can take to introduce your directors to your Loomio group and get them using it.</p>
<p>To galvanise you for the work, here’s a reminder of the benefits your corporation can reap when directors invest their time and energy in connected governance:</p>
<p><strong>Benefits of connected governance</strong></p>
<p>The board will own a secure, private space for its business and processes.</p>
<ul>
<li>Every director can see who said what, when.</li>
<li>Every director can contribute in their own time.</li>
<li>The board can do routine tasks online to free up time in meetings for discussions that matter.</li>
<li>Polls offer directors a powerful way to gain a wholeboard perspective.</li>
<li>When directors disagree, they can see where and why, and work to build consensus.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Purpose: To set up Loomio effectively for your board.</strong></p>
<p>Our aim is to encourage directors to join and participate in your Loomio group. They should be easily able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Loomio ( decisions.oric.gov.au )</li>
<li>Read and comment on threads</li>
<li>Vote in polls and proposals</li>
<li>See how your governance practices work in Loomio</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Using this Guide</strong></p>
<p>There are a series of steps to the guide. Work through these or navigate to a section using the table of contents.  Reach out to <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact">Loomio support</a> for further help if needed.</p>

<h1 id="are-your-directors-ready-for-connected-governance"><a class="header" href="#are-your-directors-ready-for-connected-governance">Are your directors ready for connected governance?</a></h1>
<p><strong>Technology &amp; digital literacy</strong></p>
<p>Connected governance requires directors to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet. They must be capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, reading digital documents and viewing and hearing videos.</p>
<p>Check that each director has all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
an <strong>up-to-date device</strong>—a computer, tablet or smart phone with email and a modern internet browser</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
<strong>internet service</strong> via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
<strong>capability</strong> to send and receive email, browse the internet, download documents and play videos.</li>
</ul>
<p>If a director lacks capability in some areas, is there a person in the corporation—or a friend or family member—who can support them?</p>
<p>Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old out-of-date browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer may not work.</p>

<h2 id="group-settings"><a class="header" href="#group-settings">Group settings</a></h2>
<p>Your Loomio group comes pre-configured to help you get started. As a connector you have administrative rights for the group.  This means you can edit group settings.</p>
<p>Please review each of the following settings and make whatever changes will best suit your corporation.</p>
<p><em>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click <strong>Edit group settings</strong>.</em></p>
<p>You will land in the settings for your group’s Profile, where you can adjust the following:</p>
<p><strong>Group name</strong>: The name of your corporation is the default. Make it your own.</p>
<p><strong>Handle</strong>: A simplified label for your group that becomes part of the web address for it. Tip short is good!</p>
<p><strong>Cover image</strong>: Upload an image that represents your corporation. <em>(Replace the stock image.)</em></p>
<p><strong>Logo</strong>: Upload your logo to appear alongside your group name when people visit your group.</p>
<p><img src="group_settings.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group Description</strong>: The group description is the first place people see when they arrive into your Loomio group. Write it to help new directors to understand the purpose of the group and the work you will do together. Provide any other information that orients people and encourages them to participate.</p>
<p>A template description for your group is provided. You can edit or replace with your own text, upload or link to any relevant documents. A wide range of formatting tools are available to help you, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Attach files</strong>: Use the paper clip icon to attach files from your computer. <em>(Find this just below the group description box.)</em></li>
<li><strong>Insert link</strong>: Go to the internet page you want to link to, copy the link to your clipboard. Highlight the text that you want to link. Click Insert link and paste the link and click <em><strong>Apply</strong></em>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>An example of a group description</strong></p>
<p><img src="group-description-template-1.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you’re happy with the group profile, check the other tabs for PRIVACY, PERMISSIONS and THREADS. You are free to make any changes you wish but the following suggestions may help.</p>
<h2 id="other-group-settings"><a class="header" href="#other-group-settings">Other Group settings</a></h2>
<p><strong>Privacy</strong> </p>
<p>Check your group privacy is set to <strong>Secret</strong>. That means people will only know the group exists if they have been invited to it.</p>
<p><img src="group_privacy.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>As group administrator you can modify what members of your group are allowed to do.  Permissions are initially set to balance safety and freedom to use the main features of Loomio.</p>
<p><img src="group_permissions.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="tags"><a class="header" href="#tags">Tags</a></h2>
<p>Use tags to make it easy to find threads of a particular type or on a particular topic.</p>
<p>Your Loomio group is pre-configured with the following tags.</p>
<p><em>Admin, AGM, Board meeting, Report, Finance, Legal, Members, Minutes, Planning, Policy, Resolution, Rule book, General meeting, Strategy, Template.</em></p>
<p>On the <em><strong>Threads</strong></em> page there is a dropdown arrow to see your tags.</p>
<p><img src="view_tags.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can create and apply tags when you start or edit a <em><strong>thread</strong></em>, <em><strong>poll</strong></em> or <em><strong>proposal</strong></em>.</p>
<p><img src="apply_tags.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Look for the tag icon. When you start typing, existing tags will appear for you to add. Or if no tag with that word exists, you can create one.</p>
<p><img src="category_tags.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="2-set-up-your-personal-profile"><a class="header" href="#2-set-up-your-personal-profile">2. Set up your personal profile</a></h1>
<p>Your personal profile will help members of your group easily identify you, and have confidence that the messages they receive from you actually come from you.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the menu icon (☰) at top left to open the sidebar menu.</li>
<li>Click on your name at the top of the sidebar to open the user menu.</li>
<li>Select <strong>Edit profile</strong> option.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="edit-profile.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="upload-a-profile-photo"><a class="header" href="#upload-a-profile-photo">Upload a profile photo</a></h2>
<p>Your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. To upload your profile photo:</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on <strong>Change Picture</strong> on the profile page</li>
<li>Select <strong>Upload new photo</strong></li>
</ul>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><img src="set-profile-photo1.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="update-your-personal-info"><a class="header" href="#update-your-personal-info">Update your personal info</a></h2>
<p>Check and update your profile on Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Name</strong> - this name will appear next to all your comments</li>
<li><strong>Email address</strong> - your Loomio notifications will go to this address</li>
<li><strong>Username</strong> - can be used to <strong>@mention</strong> you in threads, so that you will be notified</li>
<li><strong>Introduction</strong> - a few lines to let others in your group know more about you, and that you are here to support their connected governance work</li>
<li><strong>Location</strong> - so people know where you (usually) are.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that your email address is not displayed to other users. Your email address can only be seen by administrators of your group in certain circumstances.</p>
<p><em>Example:</em></p>
<p><img src="update-profile.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="3-manage-group-membership"><a class="header" href="#3-manage-group-membership">3. Manage group membership</a></h1>
<p>Next, make sure all your directors have been invited to the group.</p>
<p>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Members</strong> tab.</p>
<p>There, you can see a list of all the members of the group.  You can also see when each member joined your group, and any invitations that have not yet been accepted.</p>
<p>If you have already invited people and they are yet to accept, you can use the 3 dot menu against their name to remind them — <strong>Resend invitation</strong>.</p>
<p>You can give anyone administrator level access with <strong>Make admin</strong> and if a person has a particular role within the group, you can give them a title such as <em><strong>chairperson</strong></em> with <strong>Set title</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="members-tab.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="adding-and-removing-members"><a class="header" href="#adding-and-removing-members">Adding and removing members</a></h2>
<p>When your board membership changes, or when you want to involve an external person in your discussions temporarily, you can adjust your group’s membership.</p>
<p>To invite people to join the group you can either:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Invite</strong> them from within Loomio by entering their email address and adding a message, or</li>
<li><strong>Share</strong> an invitation link via your email or other messaging service.</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’re granting temporary membership, it’s a good idea to check <a href="guide-connectors.html##other-group-settings">member permissions</a>.</p>
<p><img src="invite-people.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="4-start-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#4-start-a-thread">4. Start a thread</a></h1>
<p>To help directors become familiar with using Loomio, try starting a new thread. It can introduce directors to the tools, and invite them to react with an emoji or comment. If every director responds, you’ll know they are all connected.</p>
<p>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Threads</strong> tab and use the button for <strong>New Thread</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="new_thread.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Thread</strong>
When you start a new thread, you can choose where it will show up.
You can:</p>
<ul>
<li>post it to a <strong>group</strong></li>
<li>post it to a <strong>subgroup</strong>, or</li>
<li>(for a private discussion with one or more people, or to draft a thread before posting it anywhere) create an <strong>Invite-only thread
(no group)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Title</strong>
Give your thread a title; a few words that capture the purpose of the discussion. It’s worth considering how best to characterise this thread to distinguish it from any other. It could be a question, or it could refer to a place or date or event or document. The point is to convey the most information with the fewest characters, bearing in mind that over time you might have many other similar threads.</p>
<p><strong>Notify</strong>
If you choose to notify people of the new thread, Loomio will send them an email about it. You can use the dropdown to select to notify members of the group or subgroup, or you can notify a <strong>guest</strong> by pasting their email address.</p>
<p>If you’re posting a series of new threads to a group, you might choose to notify no one. That way, the members will see it when they next come to Loomio, but they won’t receive an email about it.</p>
<p><strong>Tag</strong>
Attach one or more tags to the thread to make it easy to find later. For this first one, perhaps a ‘how-to’ tag is appropriate?</p>
<p><strong>Context</strong>
In the context, describe the purpose of the thread. You’ll see there are buttons for formatting the text, adding links and documents, but for your first thread, keep it simple.</p>
<p><strong>First thread suggestion</strong></p>
<p><img src="Start_first_thread.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Comment</strong>
After you post the thread, you’ll see it’s possible to comment or to react with an emoji. Be sure to add a comment to demonstrate how to participate and explicitly ask people to respond.</p>
<h1 id="5-start-a-poll"><a class="header" href="#5-start-a-poll">5. Start a poll</a></h1>
<p>Now, it’s time to familiarise directors with some of Loomio’s unique tools for discovering what the board as a whole thinks about something, and for moving from a discussion toward a decision.</p>
<p>The objective here is to get everyone to vote in a poll.</p>
<p>From within a thread, go to the tab marked <strong>POLL</strong>. You’ll see there are various options. The simplest one is <strong>Check</strong>. With this poll type, there are only two possible responses:</p>
<ul>
<li>a tick (✓) to say ‘yes’ or</li>
<li>a cross (x) to say ‘no’ or ‘unsure’.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="choose_poll.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Use a check poll to ask directors to confirm they are comfortable in Loomio. </p>
<p>A day before the poll closes, Loomio will remind those who have not responded.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong>
Give your poll a short, relevant Title.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong>
Attach any relevant Tags to help people find this poll later.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong>
In the Details field, explain what you are asking people to do.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong>
Each poll type provides different Options for responding. (In a check poll there are only 2.)</p>
<p>Consider the further options:</p>
<p><strong>Closing date and time</strong>
Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong>
24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is <strong>Undecided voters</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who can vote?</strong>
Invite everyone in the group or only the people.</p>
<p>By default, everyone in the group can see everyone's votes. But you can change that to make voting <strong>anonymous</strong> if you want to keep the individual votes secret. This is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.</p>
<p><strong>Check poll suggestion</strong></p>
<p><img src="start_check.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>
<p>Here is what people will see when responding to a poll request to vote:</p>
<p><img src="check_vote.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="6-set-up-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#6-set-up-a-subgroup">6. Set up a subgroup?</a></h1>
<p>Do you need a subgroup?  To determine whether your board needs one or more subgroups, see <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/oric/for-success.html#what-structure-suits-our-board">&quot;Setting up for success: What structure suits our board?&quot;</a>.</p>
<p>To set up a subgroup, go to your group home page and toggle to the <strong>Subgroups</strong> tab. You’ll see a button there for <strong>New Subgroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Setting up a subgroup is similar to setting up a group. After you have created the group, check the settings as you did for the parent group.</p>
<p>To review group settings, see <a href="guide-connectors.html#1-adjust-group-settings-for-the-board">Step 1</a> to set up your subgroup.</p>
<p><img src="Subgroups.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>Do you want members of the parent group to be able to see subgroups even though they are not members of it? If so, on your subgroup home page, go to the settings cog and click <strong>Edit group settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Next, toggle to the <strong>PERMISSIONS</strong> tab. You’ll see a long list of options for who can do what. You can tick or untick as appropriate.
The very first one (if you are an admin for the group) is ‘Members of [your parent group] can see private threads’. If you tick that option, everyone will be able to see—but not participate in—threads and polls in the subgroup.</p>

<p><em>This page will help your board make best use of Loomio's platform and tools.</em></p>
<p>Adopting Loomio will take <strong>conscious effort</strong>. It means a <strong>new way of working</strong>—as a whole board and as individual directors. </p>
<p>Using Loomio can save you time and improve your decisions and your accountability. But to reap those rewards, the first step is to agree on how to make best use of the platform and the tools. 'Best use' is not universal; it depends on the circumstances of your corporation and your directors. </p>

<h2 id="what-structure-suits-our-board"><a class="header" href="#what-structure-suits-our-board">What structure suits our board?</a></h2>
<p>A Loomio group comprises a 'parent group' and any number of 'subgroups'. </p>
<p>Subgroups are separate from the parent group but connected to it, and they work just like groups. Subgroups help focus and contain the work of particular groups of people, such as a committee, council or project team. </p>
<p>You can keep a subgroup private, so that parent group members can't see anything in it. But maybe you want the subgroup to be readily accountable to the parent group. If so, you can set it so members of the parent group can see (but not respond to) threads and polls in the subgroup. </p>
<p>As an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation, and depending on your size, you might have a subgroup for:</p>
<ul>
<li>a finance committee</li>
<li>a health &amp; safety committee</li>
<li>a risk &amp; audit committee</li>
<li>industry-specific tasks, such as managing property</li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, you can add outsiders to a subgroup—such as a lawyer or accountant or staff-member.</p>
<p>You could even set up <strong>a subgroup for all your members</strong>—so as directors you can share information and engage with the broader membership. </p>
<p>With all that in mind, a cautionary note: while you are still new to Loomio, we encourage you to focus on your parent group—and getting all board members to engage in open, constructive idea-sharing and responding. You can always add a subgroup later, if need be. But maybe there's a better way to organise your work, such as tagging each thread with relevant terms (eg finance) so you can easily find them again, or creating a private thread (when you need to speak in confidence to one or more people).</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-invite-outsiders-in"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-invite-outsiders-in">When should we invite outsiders in?</a></h2>
<p>There may be times when it would be useful to involve someone from outside the corporation in a particular discussion. As noted, an external person can be part of a subgroup. In any one thread of the main (parent) group, you can also invite an outsider in—to see and respond. At the top of every thread is a button to 'invite'. When you hit it, you can add an email address. </p>
<p>You might want some protocols for inviting external people. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Do you need the board to approve, before you send an invitation—or at least the chair? </li>
<li>Or do you agree as a board that any one of you can use your discretion to invite someone in as you see fit? </li>
<li>Will you want to remove the extra person after a certain time?</li>
</ul>

<p>Below we describe how you could perform typical governance tasks in Loomio.</p>
<ol>
<li>You might use a Loomio thread to take strategic action <strong>between board meetings</strong>:</li>
</ol>
<table><thead><tr><th>Between-meetings work</th><th>Loomio tools</th></tr></thead><tbody>
<tr><td><strong>Start thinking</strong> about the next board meeting</td><td><strong>New thread</strong>—Give it a <strong>title</strong> that will make sense to everyone, and add some notes about the <strong>context</strong> for the thread, eg: thinking about the next phase of our governance work</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Agree on a focus</strong> for the next meeting</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—What's the most important focus for our next meeting? Either suggest something, or invite responses to the open question. You might reach general agreement through discussion. Or you could use a <strong>proposal</strong> or <strong>poll</strong> to clarify and settle on a priority.</td></tr>
<tr><td>Check progress on <strong>actions arising</strong> from the last meeting</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—use a <strong>checklist</strong> to post a list of tasks and who they were assigned to, and ask each person to check them off and/or comment. Note: later, when you have a thread to announce the meeting, you might <strong>move this comment</strong> there—the replies will go with it.</td></tr>
<tr><td><strong>Share</strong> information and ideas to consider in relation to the strategic or business plan</td><td><strong>New comment</strong>—introduce a report or other material relevant to the strategy or operations, and invite responses. You can <strong>attach a file</strong> or <strong>link</strong> to a published document.</td></tr>
</tbody></table>
<ol start="2">
<li>When it's time to <strong>get organised for the next meeting</strong>, set up a new thread dedicated to preparing for it:</li>
</ol>
<table><thead><tr><th>Announcing the next meeting</th><th>Loomio tools</th></tr></thead><tbody>

<tr><td><strong>Focus discussion</strong> on a particular agenda item</td><td>Add a <strong>new comment</strong> to elaborate on an agenda item and focus discussion on it.

<p>Because Loomio discussions and decisions are always already documented, it provides a robust way to verify all your board's decision-making. You can easily demonstrate what was decided, and when. If directors have discussed and commented, as well as voted on a resolution—you will also know how and why each decision was reached. </p>
<p>A resolution passed in between meetings is valid if (and only if) <em>all</em> eligible directors agree on it. You can ratify (formally approve) the decision at the next board meeting. That way, the decision will also appear in the minutes of the meeting.</p>
<p>If you have less than 100% agreement, or if some directors have not voted, you will need to take the resolution to your next board meeting (whether online or in person). Then, you can use quorum and majority rules to ratify (or alter) the decision. The Loomio record will give you a good sense of any issues with the proposed resolution. So it shouldn't take long to resolve the matter one way or the other.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="how-quickly-do-we-expect-each-other-to-respond"><a class="header" href="#how-quickly-do-we-expect-each-other-to-respond">How quickly do we expect each other to respond?</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is like email in that you can respond at a time that suits you. But everyone has different work habits, and if some people taking much longer than others to respond, it can frustrate people and hinder progress.</p>
<p>Quick responses are great because they keep things moving. On the other hand, people need time to access, read and digest the information—especially when it's a complex or important matter.</p>
<p>It's up to your group to <strong>consider what's a reasonable response time</strong> in your circumstances. It's important to discuss it as a board, and reach an agreement. Then, if someone is continually non-responsive, at the next meeting you can refer back to the agreement and ask that director and everyone else how the board should handle the issue. </p>
<p>There are also tools in Loomio to prompt people to respond. If the issue is that someone has not contributed to an important discussion, you might post a poll or a proposal to alert everyone that now is the time to have their say. When you post a proposal or poll, you can set how long it stays open. You can also use a comment to remind people to respond, and if you want to notify a particular person of a comment, you can @mention them by name.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-notify-people-of-group-activity"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-notify-people-of-group-activity">When should we notify people of group activity?</a></h2>
<p>In Loomio, <strong>notifying means sending an email</strong>. So to avoid overloading your directors' inboxes, it's best to notify only when something important is happening, or if you really need to get the board's attention.</p>
<p>There are many places within Loomio that you can notify people including when you:</p>
<ul>
<li>invite people to a thread</li>
<li>invite people to respond to a poll or proposal</li>
<li>@mention a specific person within a comment</li>
</ul>
<p>When you post a thread to notify directors about the next meeting, it may include several polls and proposals. Rather than sending a notification for each one, it is better to notify people once, about the thread, and ask them to read through, comment and vote in any polls or proposals.</p>
<p>As a board you might consider what works for you, and establish a protocol, so you receive the notifications you need and avoid being overwhelmed.</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-start-a-new-thread"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-start-a-new-thread">When should we start a new thread?</a></h2>
<p>If you're wondering whether to start a new thread, ask yourself: would a new thread make it easier to manage the discussion? If you're still talking about the same topic, it makes sense to allow a thread to keep growing. At some point it might become too long to be easy to navigate. In that case, you might find a natural break and start a new thread. For example, if you have a thread for budget planning, you probably want to limit it to planning for a specific year. </p>
<p>When a thread is no longer active, or no longer relevant to the current discussion, you can <strong>close it</strong>. The thread will still be there, but you'll have to <strong>view closed threads</strong> to see it.</p>
<p>If the discussion in a thread veers off to a new topic, and that topic needs further discussion, start a new thread. </p>
<p>In the new thread, you can add links to the old thread and/or to specific comments in another thread.</p>
<p>There are tools within Loomio that enable you to:</p>
<ul>
<li>copy a link to a thread or a comment, or </li>
<li>move a comment to another thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, it's up to your board to consider how to manage your discussions so you can more easily navigate and participate. You might want to set up protocols for:</p>
<ul>
<li>starting a new thread: can any director start a thread or only the connector/s? Are there conventions to use when adding a title and context?</li>
<li>closing a thread: can any director close a thread or only the connector/s? </li>
<li>will the connector do occasional housekeeping to keep threads tidy and easy to navigate?</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="how-do-we-know-what-kind-of-poll-to-use"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-know-what-kind-of-poll-to-use">How do we know what kind of poll to use?</a></h2>
<p>Loomio offers various kinds of poll. They are useful in a wide range of circumstances, and sometimes there's no clear-cut reason for using one over another. </p>
<p>For your governance work you will likely use the first 3 the most. </p>
<h3 id="check"><a class="header" href="#check">Check</a></h3>
<p>A check poll has only 2 responses: a tick (✔) for 'yes' and a cross (✘) for 'no'. You might use a check poll to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check if directors are ready for the next board meeting. It's good to know that people are prepared, and important to know if someone is missing some important information.</li>
<li>Check if directors approve the minues of the last meeting. You can attach a file to the poll (e.g. 'Minutes.doc') and anyone who responds with a ✘ can add a comment to identify something that needs correcting.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Can we add small images linked to full-size? (So they're not overwhelming): check-poll-setup.gif and check-poll-view.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="poll"><a class="header" href="#poll">Poll</a></h3>
<p>A simple poll is good for when there are several options and you can only choose one. For example, you might use it to decide:</p>
<ul>
<li>where to hold your next in-person meeting</li>
<li>which of 3 quotes to accept </li>
<li>who to give an award to</li>
</ul>
<p>You can set it to be single-choice or multiple-choice. </p>
<p><em>Insert simple-poll-setup.gif and simple-poll-view.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="time"><a class="header" href="#time">Time</a></h3>
<p>Use a time poll to find the best time to meet. Provide a few different options. Everyone marks each time with good, doable or bad. Then, Loomio shows you the best time. From there, you can send a calendar invitation to all your board members.</p>
<p><em>Insert time-poll-illustration.gif</em></p>
<h3 id="dot"><a class="header" href="#dot">Dot</a></h3>
<p>A dot vote could be useful if you want to know, for example, which 3 out of 7 possible options people most want. A person can put all 3 eggs in one basket (if they're really keen on that option and otherwise don't mind) or allocate one vote each to 3 different options.</p>
<h3 id="score"><a class="header" href="#score">Score</a></h3>
<p>A score poll might be useful in <strong>shortlisting candidates</strong> for a job.</p>
<h3 id="ranked-choice"><a class="header" href="#ranked-choice">Ranked choice</a></h3>
<p>A ranked choice poll is good when there are many options and you want people to choose a few and put them in order of preference. You might use it for an election where there are, say, 100 voters, 10 candidates and only 3 positions. It could be a good way to enable your members <strong>to elect the next board of directors</strong>?</p>
<hr />
<h2 id="when-should-we-use-a-proposal-instead-of-a-poll"><a class="header" href="#when-should-we-use-a-proposal-instead-of-a-poll">When should we use a proposal instead of a poll?</a></h2>
<p>Proposals are best when there's only one option on the table. For example, you might use a proposal to agree:</p>
<ul>
<li>to lodge a funding application</li>
<li>on the new terms of a lease</li>
<li>to approve the annual financial statements</li>
<li>to form a subcommittee</li>
<li>to put a special resolution to members</li>
<li>on a shift in strategic direction</li>
<li>to invite a guest to a board meeting</li>
<li>to recruit the preferred candidate for CEO </li>
<li>to accept an insurance quotation</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="approving-financial-reports---what-directors-should-consider"><a class="header" href="#approving-financial-reports---what-directors-should-consider">Approving financial reports - what directors should consider</a></h1>
<p>Directors do need to remember that they are not expected to be experts in financial reporting requirements. Nevertheless, a director’s duty is to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Appropriate expertise is applied;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Due process is sound;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Essential elements of the process are scrutinised and tested by directors.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Legislative responsibilities are met. </li>
</ul>
<p>This will lead to a director’s confidence in the integrity of the outputs of the financial and management systems.</p>
<p>The following is a list of questions that directors could consider before approving financial statements, where relevant.  This list does not attempt to examine all areas that may be ‘critical’ to every organisation as each organisation has its own unique critical areas.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that these questions would be among those posed by the audit committee, and that the answers would be obtained from management.</p>
<p><em>Also see the companion guide for common questions to ask about financial statements.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="questioning-financials.html">Finance report - Questions directors could ask</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Do the financial statements make sense and present realistically the results, cash flows and state of affairs of the company?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to look for what is expected – if it isn't present, the question “why?” should be asked. The better a director understand their business the easier it becomes for them to understand the financial statements.</p>
<p>Many director's questions will involve the timing of when information needs to be recorded in the accounting system and if the numbers recorded are appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<p>The major concern in this area is whether assets are recorded in the financial statements at an appropriate amount: that is, not exceeding their recoverable amount.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are any asset values too high? Has the value been impaired and must be reduced?</strong></p>
<p>Organisations are not allowed to record an asset at a value materially higher than its recoverable amount. The Recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (this involves a future cash flow estimation).</p>
<p><strong>3. Does the organisation revalue any of its assets?</strong></p>
<p>If yes, when was the last time an independent valuation was conducted? If an independent valuation is not carried out, how has management determined that the book value of those assets is not more than the recoverable amount?</p>
<p>Once an organisation commences revaluing its assets it must continue to assess their valuation every year. An Independent valuation is not required. If the valuation is determined internally (usually by management) it is referred to as a directors’ valuation. Businesses would generally have a financial policy outlining if and when an independent valuation should be sought.</p>
<p>When an organisation commences the revaluation process,it must revalue all assets within a class: for example land would be a class of assets, and an organisation cannot revalue one parcel of land and ignore another.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do any non-current assets need to be recorded in the current asset section as a ‘non-current asset held for sale’?</strong></p>
<p>Non-current assets such as land should be reclassified as a current asset if it is available for sale and the recoverable amount is material to the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is the asset register up-to-date? Have fixed assets been depreciated appropriately?</strong></p>
<p>Fixed assets (plant and equipment, furniture and fittings,buildings, motor vehicles, computers, etc.) all need to be systematically depreciated over their useful life. Is there a depreciation policy and are assets depreciated accordingly?</p>
<p><strong>6. Do all bank balances reconcile to the bank statements?</strong></p>
<p>This is to ensure accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><strong>7. What steps have been taken to ensure that inventories are recorded at the lower cost and net realisable value?</strong></p>
<p>The rule for carrying inventory on the balance sheet isto value the item at the lower of cost or its net realisable value. However for NFPs that distribute their inventory free of charge, inventory at cost can be carried on the balance sheet despite the realisable amount being $0.</p>
<p><strong>8. What physical checks have been made to confirm inventories exist?</strong></p>
<p>Despite businesses using perpetual inventory systems,it is still important to conduct a stocktake to ensure the accuracy of the system.</p>
<p><strong>9. What steps have been taken to ensure that the book value of receivables is recoverable in full?</strong></p>
<p>The organisation must assess if it thinks any of the receivables owing to the organisation are not likely to be collected. If this is the case the bad debts need to be written-off so that receivables are not overvalued on the balance sheet.</p>
<h2 id="liabilities"><a class="header" href="#liabilities">Liabilities</a></h2>
<p>The major concern in this area is whether all liabilities of the organisation are included in the financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>10. How has it been determined that all creditors have been included in the financial statements?</strong></p>
<p>The organisation needs to ensure all invoices have been recorded in the accounting system at year end so that there is a clear indication of payables owing.</p>
<p><strong>11. How has it been determined that the level of provisions is adequate?</strong></p>
<p>Provisions are an estimate and can therefore be underestimated. It’s important to ensure that the organisation is comfortable that the amount being reported is high enough.</p>
<p><strong>12. When does the organisation start to accrue long service leave for its employees? Is the current practice/policy considered to be appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>This is a big issue for not-for-profit organisations that are heavily funded through grants. Employee costs need to be fully acquitted against grants in the year of employment, not 5/7/10 years later.</p>
<p><strong>13. Does the organisation have any grant income that spans more than one financial year or the grant income has not been fully justified during the financial year?</strong></p>
<p>Whether grant income unspent or received in advance at balance date is deferred or treated as a liability on the balance sheet depends on the terms and conditions of the grant received.
Where the grants are reciprocal and there are enforceable obligations the amount received in advance or unspent is usually recognised as a liability on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Where such terms and conditions do not exist no liability is recognised and the full amount is recognised as revenue when control of the funds is obtained.</p>
<p><strong>14. Does the organisation have any operating leases?</strong></p>
<p>Although notes are included in the financial statements that explain operating leases exist and when payments are required, they do not appear on the face of the balance sheet.</p>
<p>This means the asset value and the liability contractare not recorded. Hence, when the asset coverage of the liabilities is assessed the calculation will ignore any operating leases.</p>
<p><strong>15. Does the organisation have any contingent liabilities?</strong></p>
<p>This is not only necessary to record as a note to the financial statements but also for risk management purposes.</p>
<p><strong>16. Have the assets and liabilities been correctly classified between the current and noncurrent sections on the balance sheet?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/governance-risk-compliance/ZA_CentroCaseConfirmsDirectorDuties_24032014.pdf">Centro case</a> has highlighted how important it is to make sure this classification is correct.</p>
<h2 id="going-concern"><a class="header" href="#going-concern">Going concern</a></h2>
<p>Before signing financial statements, directors must be satisfied that the organisation can meet its debts as and when they fall due:</p>
<p><strong>17. What coverage exists between the asset values and the level of liabilities? How liquid are the assets?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to understand what level of solvency risk exists for the organisation both from a 12 month perspective and overall. This depends on the level of coverage the organisation has between its assets and liabilities and how easily the assets can be converted to cash if required.</p>
<p><strong>18. Has a detailed cash flow forecast for the following year been prepared and reviewed by senior management?</strong></p>
<p>The cash flow forecast provides the picture of what is expected to happen with the organisation's cash across the following 12 months. It will highlight cash flow issues in advance so that they can be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>19. What are the major assumptions underlying the cash flow forecast and are all loan repayments and capital commitments included?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to be comfortable with the underlying assumptions used and that all cash requirements are included on the forecast (that is, not just a cash projection of revenue and expenses).</p>
<p><strong>20. What other issues are relevant in determining that the company can pay its debts as and when they fall due, particularly during the next twelve months?</strong></p>
<p>The following subset of questions should be considered: </p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity of the asset base. Can any assets be sold if required? </li>
<li>Is the organisation able to renegotiate milestone payment within funding agreements? </li>
<li>How are accounts receivables and accounts payable being managed? </li>
<li>Is the organisation in a position to take out a loan or does the organisation have an overdraft facility inplace? It’s always easier to organise these facilities when they are not really needed than to wait until they are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compliance-with-accounting-standards-and-the-external-auditors"><a class="header" href="#compliance-with-accounting-standards-and-the-external-auditors">Compliance with accounting standards and the external auditors</a></h2>
<p>Accounting standards have the force of the law and must be followed when preparing general purpose financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>21. What are the key accounting standards that affect the organisation and how does management ensure compliance with these standards?</strong></p>
<p>Accounting standards change regularly. It’s important to be aware of any standards that have changed during the year and if the changes will have a material impact on the way the organisation presents its financial information.</p>
<p><strong>22. Have the auditors expressed any concerns about how an accounting standard has been interpreted?</strong></p>
<p>Accounting is all about interpretation of accounting rules. An organisation’s accountant may have a different view to its auditor’s interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>23. Will the auditors provide an unqualified opinion on their audit report?</strong></p>
<p>A qualified opinion may not just be an interpretation issue, but may be due to other more serious concerns which will need to be investigated. It is recommended that the board or the audit committee have an opportunity to meet with the auditors without management present to have a free discussion about any issues that the board or the auditors want to raise.</p>
<h2 id="general"><a class="header" href="#general">General</a></h2>
<p>This section deals with other areas of enquiry a prudent person would make before signing financial statements, and to ensure the substance (over the form) of the financial statements prevails.</p>
<p><strong>24. Have all the necessary notes to the financial statements been correctly recorded? Do the figures in the notes match the figures on the face of the statements?</strong></p>
<p>The accounting standards also outline the information required to be included in the notes to the statements. Have these requirements been met?</p>
<p><strong>25. Are there any matters included in the financial statements that could be viewed as misleading?</strong></p>
<p>The board of directors are accountable to the members of the organisation. Full disclosure and transparency is always the best approach.</p>
<p><strong>26. Are any of the directors aware of anything, from their personal knowledge or warnings from outside sources, which should be considered before signing?</strong></p>
<p>Board information shouldn’t just come from management. Director knowledge and understanding should involve listening to the external environment: for example are there any complaints from suppliers that invoices are not paid on time?</p>
<p><strong>27. Have the year-end financial statements been finalised by internal staff, an external accounting firm or assistance from the auditors?</strong></p>
<p>Many small NFP organisations rely on external assistance in finalising their year-end financial
statements. Be aware of what assistance may be required by the finance team at year end either due to lack of internal resources or the expertise required.</p>
<p><strong>28. How does management ensure that there have been no major breakdowns in internal controls that may have a material effect on the financial statements,either now or in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The internal control system is an important part of protecting an organisation, including the accuracy of the financial data. Many not-for-profit organisations are not large enough
to employ internal auditors, whose role it is to review and improve this system. It’s important to be satisfied that the organisation has appropriate measures in place to review and improve these controls. This may involve using an external accounting firm to audit certain processes within the organisation on a rotating basis. Also the organisation should ensure it has process and procedures manuals in place and that they are followed and reviewed regularly.</p>

<p>Consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is our organisation so complex that managing finances becomes difficult to understand without understanding the complex details?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is our cashflow always under consideration? <em>For example, if you are a startup and your cash runway only extends a few months and small changes in financial position have large strategic implications.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you a large entity? <em>I.e if you are managing a large quantity of money - ensuring good oversight is critical.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have lots of compliance and accountability responsibilities to adhere to? <em>How are you ensuring that the company/org is meeting requirements?</em></p>
</li>
</ol>
