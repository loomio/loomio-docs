<p><em>This guide is intended for corporations in the ORIC–Loomio pilot program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking help to use Loomio for good governance.</em></p>
<p>Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's <strong>context</strong> and set up a system and processes to serve its <strong>purpose</strong> and meet their <strong>obligations</strong> under the law.</p>
<p><em>“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”</em> That's a <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf">description of good governance</a> from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.</p>
<p>Open communication is at its heart.</p>
<p>You can use Loomio to strengthen governance: <strong>collaborate</strong> beyond board meetings, <strong>include everyone</strong> in open, honest and respectful discussion, and <strong>document everything</strong> as you go. Then when directors do come together at the same time, they can ratify all the key decisions.</p>
<p>Loomio—and this guide to using it—will help your board to <strong>communicate well</strong>, <strong>make good decisions</strong> and <strong>be accountable</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="sandpit"><a class="header" href="#sandpit">Sandpit</a></h2>
<p>If you want to try out a Loomio group—start a thread, comment, create a proposal or poll—with no impact on your real Loomio group, you can <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">create a temporary demo group</a>. Think of it as a sandpit. Feel free to play around, respond to a thread or a poll, or create your own. </p>
<h2 id="templates"><a class="header" href="#templates">Templates</a></h2>
<p>When you create a demonstration group (as above, in the 'sandpit') you'll see examples of threads you might create in your real group for the board of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. You'll see how to use Loomio to:</p>
<ul>
<li>prepare for board meeting</li>
<li>draft and approve minutes of a meeting</li>
<li>assign a task to someone</li>
<li>vote on a resolution</li>
<li>empower a subcommittee to make recommendations or decisions.</li>
</ul>
<p>Loomio is also building a new feature that will support you in common tasks like preparing for a board meeting. When that feature goes live, you won't have to create a new thread from scratch. You'll be able to create a thread from a template.</p>

<p>Loomio is a collaborative working space, shaped for making decisions — to achieve outcomes in line with your purpose.</p>

<h2 id="key-concepts"><a class="header" href="#key-concepts">Key concepts</a></h2>
<h3 id="group"><a class="header" href="#group">Group</a></h3>
<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for your organisation to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.</p>
<p><img src="Groups.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group home</strong></p>
<p>Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help members participate.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroups</strong></p>
<p>Subgroups are a space for a smaller subset of people to focus on a project or committee work.</p>
<p>Depending on the settings, the subgroup can be visible to the broader group, or for subgroup members' eyes only.</p>
<h3 id="thread"><a class="header" href="#thread">Thread</a></h3>
<p>Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.</p>
<p><img src="Threads.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>Threads are used for many purposes. In a board, you will use threads to prepare for a board meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on resolutions, approve minutes, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a consensus or at least a shared understanding of issues important to you.</p>
<p>Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organisation’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<h3 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h3>
<p>One of the best things about Loomio is its range of tools for gaining a clear view of where your group stands on any matter. Each tool has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. </p>
<p><img src="Proposals.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>proposal</strong> is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask group members to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree</li>
<li>abstain or </li>
<li>disagree. </li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone in the group has a chance to explain what prompted it. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. </p>
<p>As well as helping your group to convert discussions into outcomes, a proposal creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>
<h3 id="other-voting-tools"><a class="header" href="#other-voting-tools">Other voting tools</a></h3>
<p>A proposal is good for suggesting a particular path and gauging who wants to take it. But sometimes you might want group members to make a different kind of choice. </p>
<p>Loomio offers a range of other poll tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll</strong>: to ask people which option/s they approve</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'</li>
<li><strong>Time poll</strong>: to find the best time for the group to do something</li>
<li><strong>Score poll</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale</li>
<li><strong>Dot vote</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out</li>
<li><strong>Ranked choice</strong>: to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats</li>
</ul>
<p>The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Use your own Loomio group or <a href="https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try">create a demo group</a>. </p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="guide-for-directors-using-loomio"><a class="header" href="#guide-for-directors-using-loomio">Guide for directors using Loomio</a></h1>
<p>Loomio is a private and secure service for your board to <strong>talk about matters, make decisions and keep track</strong> of everything.</p>

<p>Good communication today requires Directors to be able to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet; capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, viewing videos and reading electronic documents.</p>
<p>Success of using an online tool like Loomio to communicate with your board requires Directors to be familiar with basic apps such as email, internet browser, document and video viewers.</p>
<p>Here is a quick check list to review with each Director:</p>
<ul>
<li>An up-to-date computer or smart phone with email, internet browser and video viewer</li>
<li>Connection to the internet via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)</li>
</ul>
<p>Know how to :</p>
<ul>
<li>Send/Receive email, browse the internet and open links to go to web pages</li>
<li>If Director is not comfortable using their computer or smart phone, is there a person in the organisation, friend of family member who can help them with these things?</li>
</ul>

<h1 id="4-start-a-first-thread"><a class="header" href="#4-start-a-first-thread">4. Start a first thread</a></h1>
<p>Start a thread to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We can use this thread to introduce Loomio to directors, and invite them to post a comment.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: Let’s get each director to post a comment so we know that directors are connected.</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Threads</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Click <strong>New Thread</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/ednBbOD.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Thread</strong></p>
<p>Threads are where your group can discuss a topic, exchange information and make decisions together. Threads keep everything about a topic in the same place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your group’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip</strong>: Use a Loomio thread instead of writing an email.</em></p>
<p><em>All the information, discussion and replies are in one place, where you can see who has read the thread, and nudge people if needed; avoiding email chain confusion.</em></p>
<p><strong>Group</strong> - Select the group or subgroup you want to post the thread in. When started, your thread will be visible to the members of your group or subgroup.</p>
<p>You can also select <strong>Invite-only thread (no group)</strong> if you want to have a private discussion with one or more people, or if you want to draft a thread before posting in your group.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - Give your thread a title; this is usually announcing a topic or asking a question. Keep it short and to the point.  A thread title is like the subject line in an email.</p>
<p><strong>Notify</strong> - You can choose to notify people by sending them an email of the thread via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.</li>
<li>Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tag</strong> - Choose a tag for your thread to make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic, or create a new tag.</p>

<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/FFVFkCd.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="5-start-a-first-poll"><a class="header" href="#5-start-a-first-poll">5. Start a first Poll</a></h1>
<p>Let’s start a poll to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We use Polls and Proposal to make decisions and request a response.</p>
<p><strong>Objective: Let's get everyone to vote in a poll, so they're ready when we get to work.</strong></p>
<p>You start a <strong>Poll</strong> or <strong>Proposal</strong> from within a Thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the thread that you wish to start your poll and click on the <strong>Poll</strong> tab.</li>
<li>Select the type of poll you want to use. Let’s start with <strong>Check</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/Vq5DB6A.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Start Check</strong></p>
<p>A check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.</p>
<p>Use it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: <em>&quot;I'm coming to the event&quot;</em>, <em>&quot;I'll join the subcommittee&quot;</em> or <em>&quot;I have completed my actions&quot;</em>.</p>
<p>A day before the check closes, Loomio will remind people who have not participated.</p>
<p><strong>Title</strong> - Give your poll a title. Keep it short and to the point.</p>
<p><strong>Tags</strong> - Select a tag that will help people easily find this poll when searching.</p>
<p><strong>Details</strong> - Explain what you are asking people to do and how to participate.</p>
<p><strong>Options</strong> - Select the poll voting options.  Each poll type provides different options.</p>
<p><strong>Closing date and time</strong> - Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder</strong> - 24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is <strong>Undecided voters</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Who can vote?</strong> - You can decide who is voting; anyone in your group or only the people you specifically invite.</p>
<p>The default settings is everyone in the group can see who has voted. However you can select anonymous voting if you want to keep the identity of voters secret. </p>
<p>*<strong>Tip</strong>: Anonymous voting is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.</p>
<p><strong>Check poll suggestion</strong></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/SpLVTMc.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Invite to vote</strong> - You can choose to invite people by sending them an email of the poll via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.</li>
<li>Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Voting</strong></p>
<p>Here is what people will see when responding to a Poll request to vote:</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/KalAqvJ.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<h1 id="6-subgroups"><a class="header" href="#6-subgroups">6. Subgroups</a></h1>
<p>Do you need a subgroup? Subgroups help you organize the work of particular groups of people; for example a subcommittee, working group or project team. You may also set up a subgroup for communicating with membership.</p>
<p>Subgroups work just like groups and are located within your &quot;parent&quot; group or organization.</p>
<p>Most of the features and settings are the same as in your parent group, and include the ability to allow members of the parent group to see, but not participate in, threads and polls in the subgroup. This is helpful if you want to offer transparency of discussions and decisions to members of the parent group.</p>
<p>A person can be a member of your subgroup and not of your parent group.</p>
<p>Typical subgroups for Indigenous Corporations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial subcommittee</li>
<li>Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Risks &amp; Audits</li>
<li>Industry-specific subgroup such as Property</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="board-subgroups.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="set-up-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#set-up-a-subgroup">Set up a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>On your group home page, go to the <strong>Subgroups</strong> tab and click <strong>New Subgroup</strong>.</p>
<p>Follow a similar process as in <a href="guide-connectors.html#1-set-up-your-board-on-loomio">Step 1</a> to set up your subgroup.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/loeydDj.png#border-none" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Permissions</strong></p>
<p>To allow members of your parent group see threads in the subgroup:</p>
<p>On your subgroup home page, go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click <strong>Edit group settings</strong>.</p>
<p>Change permissions by ticking or un-ticking the check box.</p>

<h1 id="why-loomio"><a class="header" href="#why-loomio">Why Loomio?</a></h1>
<p>Loomio is an online place for the board to have discussions and make decisions together:</p>
<ul>
<li>Accessible, transparent and inclusive; stay connected wherever you have internet access</li>
<li>Build consensus</li>
<li>A safe place for all communications, information, deliberations, decisions and records of the the board</li>

<p>Good governance exists where an organisation has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organisation to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.</p>
<p><em>“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”</em></p>
<p>Underpinning all of these principles is the need for good communication.</p>
<p>Many directors and boards of Indigenous Corporations experience challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting directors together in person</li>
<li>Difficulty for directors to join online video meetings</li>
<li>Unfamiliarity with online technology</li>
<li>In remote locations with poor internet connectivity</li>
<li>Governance practices still forming</li>
<li>Dealing with a high volume of transactional business (e.g. approving land and financial transactions)</li>
</ul>
<p>Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion while documenting everything.</p>

<p>Your group is private, and you are in control of who you invite to the group, and therefore who has access to information in the group.</p>
<p><strong>Who can access the information?</strong> 
Only people who are invited to the group. Click on the <strong>Members</strong> tab to see members of your group.</p>
<p><strong>Can ORIC access the information?</strong> 
No. Named Loomio staff members (Michael and Rahul) may be present in your group to help you with set up. They will leave the group when established or you can remove them from the group at any time.</p>
<p><strong>Can I invite an adviser or accountant into a particular discussion?</strong>
Yes. You can invite an external person to contribute to a particular Loomio thread discussion.</p>

<p>A Loomio group comprises a 'parent group' and any number of 'subgroups'. </p>
<p>Subgroups help you organize the work of particular groups of people; for example a subcommittee, working group or project team. You may also set up a subgroup for communicating with membership.</p>
<p>Subgroups work just like groups. Most of the features and settings of subgroups are the same as in your parent group, and include the ability to allow members of the parent group to see, but not participate in, threads and polls in the subgroup. This is helpful if you want to offer transparency of discussions and decisions to members of the parent group.</p>
<p>A person can be a member of your subgroup and not of your parent group.</p>
<p>Typical subgroups for Indigenous Corporations include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Financial subcommittee</li>
<li>Health &amp; Safety</li>
<li>Risks &amp; Audits</li>
<li>An industry-specific subgroup, such as &quot;Property&quot;</li>
<li>Membership</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="board-subgroups.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You may also want to set up a subgroup to share information and engage with Corporation membership. </p>
<p>Always review subgroup privacy and permissions are set appropriate for the  work of the subgroup. </p>

<p>Loomio is like email in that you can respond at a time that suits you. However everyone has different work habits, and taking too long to respond is likely to be frustrating for others.</p>
<p>In the early days of using Loomio, it really helps if everyone responds as soon as they can with a comment, vote or reaction.</p>
<p>On the other hand, when posting a thread or comment don't expect everyone to respond immediately. Give people time to read and digest the information - particularly on complex or important topics.</p>
<p>If people are not responding, you can prompt them through Loomio by sending a reminder or with a comment using @mention.</p>
<p>Use Polls and Proposals so people can see that something is happening, and that now is the time to have their say.</p>
<p>If some people are still not responding, raise a discussion at your next board meeting and seek agreement on the importance of good communication and commitment to timely response. </p>

<h2 id="what-protocols-do-you-want-to-establish-in-relation-to-notifying-individual-people"><a class="header" href="#what-protocols-do-you-want-to-establish-in-relation-to-notifying-individual-people">What protocols do you want to establish in relation to notifying individual people?</a></h2>
<p>There are many places within Loomio that you can notify people including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Invite to a Thread</li>
<li>Invite to a Poll or Proposal</li>
<li>@mention a specific person within a comment</li>
</ul>
<p>When you notify a person, you are sending them an email. So to avoid overloading their inbox, it's usually best to only notify people when something important is happening, or if you need to get their attention.</p>
<p>If you are setting up a Thread to notify directors about the next meeting, it may include several Polls and Proposals.  Rather than sending notifications to every event, it is usually sufficient to notify people once about the Thread, and ask them to read the information and vote in any Polls or Proposals.</p>
<p>It is a advisable to have a quick discussion with your group to establish a protocol that works for them, so they receive the notifications they need and are not overwhelmed with too many.</p>

<p>Loomio Threads usually focus on a particular topic.  As the discussion progresses on the topic, the thread continues until it reaches an outcome.</p>
<p>If a new topic is introduced during your discussion in the thread, you may wish to start a new thread.  In the new thread, you can add links to the old thread and even to specific comments, making reference to the previous discussion.</p>
<p>There are tools within Loomio that enable you to copy, edit and move comments to another thread.</p>
<p>Here are some common types of threads in governance:</p>
<ul>
<li>Holding all the information about a particular meeting</li>
<li>Reports (e.g. Chief Executive or Financial subcommittee reports)</li>
<li>Preparing and agreeing a Resolution</li>
<li>Explore an important question</li>
<li>Prepare for an event, such as a members meeting</li>
<li>Collaborate on a policy document</li>

<p>There are several Loomio Polls and they have a wide application. You will likely find the following Polls valuable for Board use.</p>
<h3 id="check-poll"><a class="header" href="#check-poll">Check Poll</a></h3>
<p>A Check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.</p>
<p>Help directors get ready for your next meeting with Loomio Check Poll. </p>
<p>Checking in with directors to ensure they're prepared and have all the information they need will save a lot of blank looks and confusion during a meeting, and save you precious meeting time.</p>
<p><em>Add Check Poll image</em></p>
<h3 id="poll"><a class="header" href="#poll">Poll</a></h3>
<p>The simple Poll can be useful for approving minutes of a directors meeting.</p>
<p>If the minutes are in a file (e.g. a Word document), attach the file to the Poll. In the Poll description, ask directors to vote to <strong>Accept</strong> or <strong>Review</strong> if they see anything they would like to discuss.</p>
<p>Set <strong>Accept</strong> and <strong>Review</strong> as the Poll options.</p>

<p>Proposals are a great way to make a decision with your board. For example; approving a financial report, passing a resolution or making an out of session decision.</p>
<p>Here are a few examples of how Proposals are used to make decisions in a board:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resolution to approve a funding application</li>
<li>Resolution to approve new terms of lease</li>
<li>Approve annual financial statements</li>
<li>Form a subcommittee</li>
<li>Approve statement to shareholders</li>
<li>Approve strategic plan</li>
<li>Inviting a guest to a board meeting</li>
<li>Approving CEO hire</li>
<li>Accept insurance quotation</li>

<p>Yes. Loomio enables documented discussion and decisions in one place.</p>
<p>Whereas some Corporations try to make decisions via email, which can be scattered and difficult to track.</p>
<p><strong>Can we run an out of session resolution?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. If you circulate a decision outside of a formal meeting it requires 100% directors to agree to it for the resolution to pass.</p>
<p>Exception: If you delegate a subcommittee to make a decision and report back to the board.</p>

<p>Directors do need to remember that they are not expected to be experts in financial reporting requirements. Nevertheless, a director’s duty is to ensure:</p>
<ul>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Appropriate expertise is applied;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Due process is sound;</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Essential elements of the process are scrutinised and tested by directors.</li>
<li><input disabled="" type="checkbox" checked=""/>
Legislative responsibilities are met. </li>
</ul>
<p>This will lead to a director’s confidence in the integrity of the outputs of the financial and management systems.</p>
<p>The following is a list of questions that directors could consider before approving financial statements, where relevant.  This list does not attempt to examine all areas that may be ‘critical’ to every organisation as each organisation has its own unique critical areas.</p>
<p>It is envisaged that these questions would be among those posed by the audit committee, and that the answers would be obtained from management.</p>
<p><em>Also see the companion guide for common questions to ask about financial statements.</em></p>
<ul>
<li><a href="questioning-financials.html">Finance report - Questions directors could ask</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="overview"><a class="header" href="#overview">Overview</a></h2>
<p><strong>1. Do the financial statements make sense and present realistically the results, cash flows and state of affairs of the company?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to look for what is expected – if it isn't present, the question “why?” should be asked. The better a director understand their business the easier it becomes for them to understand the financial statements.</p>
<p>Many director's questions will involve the timing of when information needs to be recorded in the accounting system and if the numbers recorded are appropriate.</p>
<h2 id="assets"><a class="header" href="#assets">Assets</a></h2>
<p>The major concern in this area is whether assets are recorded in the financial statements at an appropriate amount: that is, not exceeding their recoverable amount.</p>
<p><strong>2. Are any asset values too high? Has the value been impaired and must be reduced?</strong></p>
<p>Organisations are not allowed to record an asset at a value materially higher than its recoverable amount. The Recoverable amount of an asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell and its value in use (this involves a future cash flow estimation).</p>
<p><strong>3. Does the organisation revalue any of its assets?</strong></p>
<p>If yes, when was the last time an independent valuation was conducted? If an independent valuation is not carried out, how has management determined that the book value of those assets is not more than the recoverable amount?</p>
<p>Once an organisation commences revaluing its assets it must continue to assess their valuation every year. An Independent valuation is not required. If the valuation is determined internally (usually by management) it is referred to as a directors’ valuation. Businesses would generally have a financial policy outlining if and when an independent valuation should be sought.</p>
<p>When an organisation commences the revaluation process,it must revalue all assets within a class: for example land would be a class of assets, and an organisation cannot revalue one parcel of land and ignore another.</p>
<p><strong>4. Do any non-current assets need to be recorded in the current asset section as a ‘non-current asset held for sale’?</strong></p>
<p>Non-current assets such as land should be reclassified as a current asset if it is available for sale and the recoverable amount is material to the organisation.</p>
<p><strong>5. Is the asset register up-to-date? Have fixed assets been depreciated appropriately?</strong></p>
<p>Fixed assets (plant and equipment, furniture and fittings,buildings, motor vehicles, computers, etc.) all need to be systematically depreciated over their useful life. Is there a depreciation policy and are assets depreciated accordingly?</p>
<p><strong>6. Do all bank balances reconcile to the bank statements?</strong></p>
<p>This is to ensure accuracy and completeness.</p>
<p><strong>7. What steps have been taken to ensure that inventories are recorded at the lower cost and net realisable value?</strong></p>
<p>The rule for carrying inventory on the balance sheet isto value the item at the lower of cost or its net realisable value. However for NFPs that distribute their inventory free of charge, inventory at cost can be carried on the balance sheet despite the realisable amount being $0.</p>
<p><strong>8. What physical checks have been made to confirm inventories exist?</strong></p>
<p>Despite businesses using perpetual inventory systems,it is still important to conduct a stocktake to ensure the accuracy of the system.</p>
<p><strong>9. What steps have been taken to ensure that the book value of receivables is recoverable in full?</strong></p>
<p>The organisation must assess if it thinks any of the receivables owing to the organisation are not likely to be collected. If this is the case the bad debts need to be written-off so that receivables are not overvalued on the balance sheet.</p>
<h2 id="liabilities"><a class="header" href="#liabilities">Liabilities</a></h2>
<p>The major concern in this area is whether all liabilities of the organisation are included in the financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>10. How has it been determined that all creditors have been included in the financial statements?</strong></p>
<p>The organisation needs to ensure all invoices have been recorded in the accounting system at year end so that there is a clear indication of payables owing.</p>
<p><strong>11. How has it been determined that the level of provisions is adequate?</strong></p>
<p>Provisions are an estimate and can therefore be underestimated. It’s important to ensure that the organisation is comfortable that the amount being reported is high enough.</p>
<p><strong>12. When does the organisation start to accrue long service leave for its employees? Is the current practice/policy considered to be appropriate?</strong></p>
<p>This is a big issue for not-for-profit organisations that are heavily funded through grants. Employee costs need to be fully acquitted against grants in the year of employment, not 5/7/10 years later.</p>
<p><strong>13. Does the organisation have any grant income that spans more than one financial year or the grant income has not been fully justified during the financial year?</strong></p>
<p>Whether grant income unspent or received in advance at balance date is deferred or treated as a liability on the balance sheet depends on the terms and conditions of the grant received.
Where the grants are reciprocal and there are enforceable obligations the amount received in advance or unspent is usually recognised as a liability on the balance sheet.</p>
<p>Where such terms and conditions do not exist no liability is recognised and the full amount is recognised as revenue when control of the funds is obtained.</p>
<p><strong>14. Does the organisation have any operating leases?</strong></p>
<p>Although notes are included in the financial statements that explain operating leases exist and when payments are required, they do not appear on the face of the balance sheet.</p>
<p>This means the asset value and the liability contractare not recorded. Hence, when the asset coverage of the liabilities is assessed the calculation will ignore any operating leases.</p>
<p><strong>15. Does the organisation have any contingent liabilities?</strong></p>
<p>This is not only necessary to record as a note to the financial statements but also for risk management purposes.</p>
<p><strong>16. Have the assets and liabilities been correctly classified between the current and noncurrent sections on the balance sheet?</strong></p>
<p>The <a href="https://www2.deloitte.com/content/dam/Deloitte/za/Documents/governance-risk-compliance/ZA_CentroCaseConfirmsDirectorDuties_24032014.pdf">Centro case</a> has highlighted how important it is to make sure this classification is correct.</p>
<h2 id="going-concern"><a class="header" href="#going-concern">Going concern</a></h2>
<p>Before signing financial statements, directors must be satisfied that the organisation can meet its debts as and when they fall due:</p>
<p><strong>17. What coverage exists between the asset values and the level of liabilities? How liquid are the assets?</strong></p>
<p>It is important to understand what level of solvency risk exists for the organisation both from a 12 month perspective and overall. This depends on the level of coverage the organisation has between its assets and liabilities and how easily the assets can be converted to cash if required.</p>
<p><strong>18. Has a detailed cash flow forecast for the following year been prepared and reviewed by senior management?</strong></p>
<p>The cash flow forecast provides the picture of what is expected to happen with the organisation's cash across the following 12 months. It will highlight cash flow issues in advance so that they can be addressed.</p>
<p><strong>19. What are the major assumptions underlying the cash flow forecast and are all loan repayments and capital commitments included?</strong></p>
<p>It’s important to be comfortable with the underlying assumptions used and that all cash requirements are included on the forecast (that is, not just a cash projection of revenue and expenses).</p>
<p><strong>20. What other issues are relevant in determining that the company can pay its debts as and when they fall due, particularly during the next twelve months?</strong></p>
<p>The following subset of questions should be considered: </p>
<ul>
<li>Liquidity of the asset base. Can any assets be sold if required? </li>
<li>Is the organisation able to renegotiate milestone payment within funding agreements? </li>
<li>How are accounts receivables and accounts payable being managed? </li>
<li>Is the organisation in a position to take out a loan or does the organisation have an overdraft facility inplace? It’s always easier to organise these facilities when they are not really needed than to wait until they are needed.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="compliance-with-accounting-standards-and-the-external-auditors"><a class="header" href="#compliance-with-accounting-standards-and-the-external-auditors">Compliance with accounting standards and the external auditors</a></h2>
<p>Accounting standards have the force of the law and must be followed when preparing general purpose financial statements.</p>
<p><strong>21. What are the key accounting standards that affect the organisation and how does management ensure compliance with these standards?</strong></p>
<p>Accounting standards change regularly. It’s important to be aware of any standards that have changed during the year and if the changes will have a material impact on the way the organisation presents its financial information.</p>
<p><strong>22. Have the auditors expressed any concerns about how an accounting standard has been interpreted?</strong></p>
<p>Accounting is all about interpretation of accounting rules. An organisation’s accountant may have a different view to its auditor’s interpretation.</p>
<p><strong>23. Will the auditors provide an unqualified opinion on their audit report?</strong></p>
<p>A qualified opinion may not just be an interpretation issue, but may be due to other more serious concerns which will need to be investigated. It is recommended that the board or the audit committee have an opportunity to meet with the auditors without management present to have a free discussion about any issues that the board or the auditors want to raise.</p>
<h2 id="general"><a class="header" href="#general">General</a></h2>
<p>This section deals with other areas of enquiry a prudent person would make before signing financial statements, and to ensure the substance (over the form) of the financial statements prevails.</p>
<p><strong>24. Have all the necessary notes to the financial statements been correctly recorded? Do the figures in the notes match the figures on the face of the statements?</strong></p>
<p>The accounting standards also outline the information required to be included in the notes to the statements. Have these requirements been met?</p>
<p><strong>25. Are there any matters included in the financial statements that could be viewed as misleading?</strong></p>
<p>The board of directors are accountable to the members of the organisation. Full disclosure and transparency is always the best approach.</p>
<p><strong>26. Are any of the directors aware of anything, from their personal knowledge or warnings from outside sources, which should be considered before signing?</strong></p>
<p>Board information shouldn’t just come from management. Director knowledge and understanding should involve listening to the external environment: for example are there any complaints from suppliers that invoices are not paid on time?</p>
<p><strong>27. Have the year-end financial statements been finalised by internal staff, an external accounting firm or assistance from the auditors?</strong></p>
<p>Many small NFP organisations rely on external assistance in finalising their year-end financial
statements. Be aware of what assistance may be required by the finance team at year end either due to lack of internal resources or the expertise required.</p>
<p><strong>28. How does management ensure that there have been no major breakdowns in internal controls that may have a material effect on the financial statements,either now or in the future?</strong></p>
<p>The internal control system is an important part of protecting an organisation, including the accuracy of the financial data. Many not-for-profit organisations are not large enough
to employ internal auditors, whose role it is to review and improve this system. It’s important to be satisfied that the organisation has appropriate measures in place to review and improve these controls. This may involve using an external accounting firm to audit certain processes within the organisation on a rotating basis. Also the organisation should ensure it has process and procedures manuals in place and that they are followed and reviewed regularly.</p>

<h3 id="typical-direct-questions"><a class="header" href="#typical-direct-questions">Typical direct questions:</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>
<p>What explains the variances between the budget and actuals? <em>Is this a good answer?</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is our balance sheet sustainable? *In other words, are we maintain an appropriate amount of expense control relative to income? *</p>

<li>
<p>Have we captured all our assets and valued them? <em>How is this kept up to date?</em></p>

<ol>
<li>
<p>If we had an audit, would we receive a clean opinion?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is our relationship with our accounting firm - or do we need one if we don't have one?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Why do we close the books and produce the financial statements on X workday each month and is that OK?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>How can we become more accurate in our cashflow forecasting?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the best metrics for measuring our profitability and productivity?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If we are ever in challenging times, where can we tighten our belts?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>What backup/BCP plans are in place in case key people in the company are unavailable to carry out their duties?</p>

<h3 id="do-you-need-a-finance-subcommittee"><a class="header" href="#do-you-need-a-finance-subcommittee">Do you need a Finance Subcommittee?</a></h3>
<p>Consider:</p>
<ol>
<li>
<p>Is our organisation so complex that managing finances becomes difficult to understand without understanding the complex details?</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is our cashflow always under consideration? <em>For example, if you are a startup and your cash runway only extends a few months and small changes in financial position have large strategic implications.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Are you a large entity? <em>I.e if you are managing a large quantity of money - ensuring good oversight is critical.</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Do you have lots of compliance and accountability responsibilities to adhere to? <em>How are you ensuring that the company/org is meeting requirements?</em></p>

<p><strong>To: Leaders and directors of Aboriginal and Torre Strait Islander Corporations</strong></p>
<p>You are invited to join the ORIC Loomio Pilot programme.</p>
<h2 id="background"><a class="header" href="#background">Background</a></h2>
<p>Boards are experiencing many challenges to effectively govern their Corporation, such as: </p>
<ul>
<li>Getting directors together in-person for meetings</li>
<li>Unfamiliarity with the use of online tools</li>
<li>Located remotely where there is poor internet connectivity</li>
<li>Unsure of governance practices, or they are still forming</li>
<li>Differing levels of engagement and understanding in the board</li>
<li>Trying to tackle a high volume of work in time constrained environment </li>
<li>Increasing regulatory reporting pressures and member/stakeholder</li>
</ul>
<p>We would like to help you develop good governance using digital communication tools and have initiated a Pilot programme.</p>
<p><img src="key-concept.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="loomio-oric-pilot"><a class="header" href="#loomio-oric-pilot">Loomio ORIC Pilot</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is an online tool for discussion and decision-making that can help you strengthen governance.</p>
<p>We have set up a special service on Loomio, along with training and support, at no cost to qualifying organisations during the Pilot.</p>
<p>We expect the project to run for approximately 12 months, until the end of April 2022.</p>
<p>We have great hopes for the project. We anticipate that using Loomio will:</p>
<ul>
<li>save you time—as a channel for the administrative business of directors’ meetings (eg sharing and approving the minutes)</li>
<li>improve corporation decision-making—as a tool designed to facilitate discussion and decision-making</li>
<li>increase transparency and accountability to members—as a conduit for key questions and decisions to members</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="want-to-learn-more"><a class="header" href="#want-to-learn-more">Want to learn more?</a></h2>
<p>We run regular online webinar sessions for your Chairperson and/or Chief Executive to learn more about how Loomio can help governance for your Corporation.</p>
<p><strong>RSVP by registering your interest with Catherine Styles at ORIC.</strong></p>
<p>Select and book your preferred webinar session:</p>
<ul>
<li>TBA</li>
</ul>
<p>The session is 1 hour duration, via Zoom video call at the following times:</p>
<ul>
<li>9am AWST</li>
<li>10.30am ACST</li>
<li>11am AEST</li>

</ul>
<h2 id="getting-started-with-loomio"><a class="header" href="#getting-started-with-loomio">Getting started with Loomio</a></h2>
<p>When you are ready to get started; please identify a person familiar with the IT and technology of your organisation, and the person who takes care of board administration. Send us their name and email addresses (it's ok if they are the same person). </p>
<p>We will then set up a Loomio group for your Corporation and get in touch to arrange training and onboarding, and book a timeslot in your next board meeting to introduce Loomio to directors. </p>
<p>We ask you to spend 10 minutes responding to a baseline survey about your corporation’s current governance.</p>
<p>And we expect you to actively use Loomio tools for your board decision-making. </p>
<p>If you have a question or concern, contact either your trained administrator or Loomio for support.</p>
<h2 id="data-sovereignty"><a class="header" href="#data-sovereignty">Data sovereignty</a></h2>
<p>Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations participating in this programme will have sovereignty over their data. ORIC will have access to metrics about their use of Loomio, and any quantitative and qualitative data that directors provide as part of evaluating their own governance and the Loomio service. ORIC will have no access to any substantive data about corporations’ deliberations or decisions.</p>
<p>Loomio takes good care in relation to your <a href="https://help.loomio.org/en/legal/privacy/">privacy</a>, and has set up a private service for this pilot on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centre in Sydney, Australia.</p>
