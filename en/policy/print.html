<p><em>All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Loomio product.</em></p>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-11-22</em></p>
<p>From everyone at Loomio, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you do your best work. There are thousands of people using Loomio products every day. Because we don't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.</p>
<p>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Loomio Limited.</p>
<p>When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by Loomio Limited, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.</p>
<p>When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.</p>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track all changes made since 2021 <a href="https://github.com/loomio/loomio-docs/tree/main/policy/src">on GitHub</a>. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our <a href="https://blog.loomio.org">blog</a>.</p>
<p>When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. <strong>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong></p>
<p>If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about <a href="https://www.loomio.com/about">who we are</a>, <a href="https://loomio.coop">how we work</a>, and keeping an open door to <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">your feedback</a>.</p>
<h2 id="account-terms"><a class="header" href="#account-terms">Account Terms</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. You must immediately notify Loomio of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. Loomio cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
<li>You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a href="terms//en/policy/abuse/index.html">Use Restrictions policy</a>. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</li>
<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.</li>
<li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="payment-automatic-renewal-and-refunds"><a class="header" href="#payment-automatic-renewal-and-refunds">Payment, Automatic Renewal and Refunds</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>By selecting a subscription you agree to pay Loomio the annual or monthly subscription fees indicated for that service. When payments begin, they will be charged on a pre-pay basis and will cover the use of that service for the following subscription period as indicated.</li>
<li>If you are upgrading your plan, either from a trial or an existing paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade.</li>
<li>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.</li>
<li>Unless you notify Loomio before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a subscription, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable fee for such subscription (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time via the billing portal or emailing contact@loomio.org.</li>
<li>When it comes to refunds, we treat our customers how we ourselves would like to be treated, and assess requests fairly. To process a refund, we must receive a request within 30 days of the date payment was made. Refunds are processed in the currency of the original transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cancellation-and-termination"><a class="header" href="#cancellation-and-termination">Cancellation and Termination</a></h2>
<p>We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly.</p>
<p><a href="terms//en/policy/subscriptions/management/index.html#cancel-your-plan">Cancel your subscription</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Our legal responsibility is to subscription owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, <a href="terms/contact@loomio.org">contact us</a>. We will gladly reach out to any current account owners we have on file.</li>
<li>You are responsible for properly canceling your account. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our <a href="terms//en/policy/subscriptions/management/#cancel-your-plan">Subscription help page</a>. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact our Support team</a>.</li>
<li>When you cancel, your group data will remain available, however you will no longer be able to start new threads or invite members to the group. After 30 days all content will be deleted from our active systems and you will no longer be able to access the data. If you want to export any data before your account is cancelled, we‘ve provided <a href="terms//en/user_manual/groups/data_export/">instructions</a>. Retrieving data for a group from a backup isn’t possible, so if you change your mind you’ll need to do it within the first 30 days. <strong>Data can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.</strong></li>
<li>We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="loomio-initiated-cancellations"><a class="header" href="#loomio-initiated-cancellations">Loomio-initiated cancellations</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>We retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time. In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in <a href="terms//en/policy/abuse/index.html">abusive behavior</a>.</li>
<li>We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our <a href="terms//en/policy/abuse/index.html">Use Restrictions policy</a>.</li>
<li>Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modifications-to-the-service-and-prices"><a class="header" href="#modifications-to-the-service-and-prices">Modifications to the Service and Prices</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>We make a promise to our customers to support our Services. That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</li>
<li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="uptime-security-and-privacy"><a class="header" href="#uptime-security-and-privacy">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. If you require a Service Level Agreement please <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">contact us</a>.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.</li>
<li>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our <a href="terms//en/policy/security/index.html">Security Overview</a> for full details and our <a href="terms//en/policy/security/response/index.html">Security Response page</a> for how to report a security incident or threat.</li>
<li>When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Loomio may process your data as described in our <a href="terms//en/policy/privacy/index.html">Privacy Policy</a> and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>To help you with support requests you make.</strong> If you contact us with a support inquiry, we may need to access your account to help resolve a problem.</li>
<li><strong>On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.</strong> We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from reoccurring.</li>
<li><strong>To safeguard Loomio.</strong> We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an <a href="terms//en/policy/abuse/how-we-handle/index.html">abuse report investigation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>To the extent required by applicable law.</strong> As a New Zealand based company with data infrastructure located in the US, EU and NZ we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches Loomio for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Loomio is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.</li>
</ul>

<li>We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services.

<li>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Loomio is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services.

<h2 id="features-and-bugs"><a class="header" href="#features-and-bugs">Features and Bugs</a></h2>
<p>We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>
<p>We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.</p>
<h2 id="services-adaptations-and-api-terms"><a class="header" href="#services-adaptations-and-api-terms">Services Adaptations and API Terms</a></h2>
<p>We offer Application Program Interfaces (&quot;API&quot;s) for some of our Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
<li>Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user's activity, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.</li>
<li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability"><a class="header" href="#limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</a></h2>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of the Company, or by the posting by the Company of a revised version. Any and all disputes arising of this agreement, termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Wellington, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or Loomio. Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<ol>
<li>The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.</li>
<li>The arbitration shall be in English. The Arbitrator in his or her discretion may permit the parties and witnesses to appear by video-conference.</li>
<li>The relationship we have with you under these terms is governed by New Zealand law.

This Agreement will be binding upon and will inure to the benefit of the parties, their successors and permitted assigns.</li>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="loomio-subscription-account-ownership--group-administration-policy"><a class="header" href="#loomio-subscription-account-ownership--group-administration-policy">Loomio Subscription Account Ownership &amp; Group Administration Policy</a></h1>
<h2 id="subscription-account-owner"><a class="header" href="#subscription-account-owner">Subscription account owner</a></h2>
<p>Any person who is a member of a Loomio trial group can signup to a paid subscription for that group and become the subscription account owner.</p>
<p>Loomio subscription accounts are owned by the organization named during subscription account signup, if this is a legal entity. If the organization is unincorporated, the account is owned by the individual who signed up for the account.</p>
<p>At signup, the subscription account owner enters customer information (name, organization and email address), billing information (credit or debit card details) and billing address.  At completion of signup, the subscription is activated immediately and the Loomio group automatically upgraded to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>A tax invoice/statement is generated and sent to the email address provided by the account owner. The statement includes a secure link to the billing portal 'Account Management' at the bottom of the statement, where the account owner can access statements, update card and contact details, and cancel the subscription.  Access to the billing portal is available only to the registered account owner, and may be verified with a link sent to the account owner's email address. </p>
<p>Card updates and account ownership can be transferred to another person or organization by signing into the billing portal with the 'Account Management' link and editing account owner information.</p>
<p>Subscription account owners can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage the account’s subscription:</strong> including updating billing information, changing account owner, and cancelling the subscription account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loomio-group-administration"><a class="header" href="#loomio-group-administration">Loomio group Administration</a></h2>
<p>The administration of a Loomio group is done by Administrators. The person who originally started the Loomio group is by default an Administrator, and can grant Admin  priviledges to any member of the group.</p>
<p>Group administrators have access to all settings and permissions for the group.</p>
<p>Administrators can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit group settings including privacy</strong> which means they can change the visibility and access to the Loomio group.</li>
<li><strong>Add and remove members, and set permissions</strong> which means they can change what group members can do in the group.</li>
<li><strong>Access and export all data in a group:</strong> that means they have the ability to read all content within the Loomio group.</li>
<li><strong>Grant and remove admin permissions:</strong> We encourage customers to share admin rights with someone you trust to help co-administer your Loomio group in the event you are unavailable.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="can-loomio-help-us-change-the-subscription-account-owner-or-administrator"><a class="header" href="#can-loomio-help-us-change-the-subscription-account-owner-or-administrator">Can Loomio help us change the Subscription account owner or Administrator?</a></h2>
<p>If the account is owned by a legal entity, we at Loomio can reassign account management if provided with enough proof that the request is coming from a top-level organizational leader. To start a request to change the Account Manager, an owner or chief executive of the organization must <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact our support team</a>.</p>
<p>From there, we may ask for more verification of identity and relationship to the organization as well as ensure that there are no pending disputes of ownership. This process will likely take several days, as we need to make absolutely sure the request is legitimate.</p>
<p>If we’re unable to verify the legitimacy of the request, or if it’s being disputed by the current Account owner, we may require a properly served court order for Loomio Limited to proceed.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="use-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#use-restrictions">Use Restrictions</a></h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-10-27</em></p>
<p>Thousands of organizations use Loomio products. We are proud to give them a trusted platform to have discussions and make decisions. We also recognize that however good the maker’s intentions, technology can amplify the ability to cause great harm. That’s why we’ve established this policy. We feel an ethical obligation to counter such harm: both in terms of dealing with instances where Loomio is used (and abused) to further such harm, and to state unequivocally that Loomio is not a safe haven for people who wish to commit such harm. If you have an account with any of our products, you can’t use them for any of the restricted purposes listed below. If we find out you are, <a href="abuse/index.html#how-we-handle-abusive-usage">we will take action</a>.</p>
<h2 id="restricted-purposes"><a class="header" href="#restricted-purposes">Restricted purposes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence, or threats thereof</strong>: If an activity qualifies as violent crime in Aotearoa New Zealand or where you live, you may not use Loomio products to plan, perpetrate, or threaten that activity.</li>
<li><strong>Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse</strong>: We don’t tolerate any activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Doxing</strong>: If you are using Loomio products to share other peoples’ private personal information for the purposes of harassment, we don’t want anything to do with you.</li>
<li><strong>Malware or spyware</strong>: Code for good, not evil. If you are using our products to make or distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware — including remote user surveillance — begone.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud</strong>: It is not okay to lie about who you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm others.</li>
<li><strong>Spamming</strong>: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate folks (including their bots) using Loomio products for spamming purposes. If your emails don’t pass muster with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">CAN-SPAM</a> or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersquatting</strong>: We don’t like username extortionists. If you purchase a Loomio product account in someone else’s name and then try to sell that account to them, you are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125">cybersquatting</a>. Cybersquatting accounts are subject to immediate cancelation.</li>
<li><strong>Infringing on intellectual property</strong>: You can’t use Loomio products to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html">fair use</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While our use restrictions are comprehensive, they can’t be exhaustive — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered. That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: Loomio is not to be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal or civic. Different points of view — philosophical, religious, and political — are welcome, but ideologies like white nationalism, or hate-fueled movements anchored by oppression, violence, abuse, extermination, or domination of one group over another, will not be accepted here.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-report-abuse"><a class="header" href="#how-to-report-abuse">How to report abuse</a></h2>
<p>For cases of suspected malware, spyware, phishing, spamming, and cybersquatting, please alert us at <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a>.</p>
<p>For all other cases, please let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a>. If you’re not 100% sure if something rises to the level of our use restrictions policy, report it anyway.</p>
<p>Please share as much as you are comfortable with about the account, the content or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it. Sending us a URL or screenshots is super helpful. If you need a secure file transfer, let us know and we will send you a link. We will not disclose your identity to anyone associated with the reported account.</p>
<p>Someone on our team will respond to let you know we’ve begun investigating. We will also let you know the outcome of our investigation (unless you ask us not to, or we are not allowed to under law).</p>
<h1 id="how-we-handle-abusive-usage"><a class="header" href="#how-we-handle-abusive-usage">How we handle abusive usage</a></h1>
<p>We build our products* to enable groups of people to make better, more inclusive decisions together. We are proud of that purpose and trust that our customers use our products for appropriate endeavors.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we discover potential abusive usage. When that happens, we investigate using the following guiding principles and process.</p>
<h2 id="guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</a></h2>
<h3 id="human-oversight"><a class="header" href="#human-oversight">Human oversight</a></h3>
<p>Who’s “we”, you ask? Our internal abuse oversight team includes our Loomio Cooperative members, and representatives from teams across Loomio Limited. On rare occasions for particularly sensitive situations or if legally required, we may also seek counsel from external experts.</p>
<h3 id="balanced-responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#balanced-responsibilities">Balanced responsibilities</a></h3>
<p>We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-evidence"><a class="header" href="#focus-on-evidence">Focus on evidence</a></h3>
<p>We base our decisions on the evidence available to us: what we see and hear account users say and do. We document what we observe and ask whether that observable evidence points to a restricted use.</p>
<h2 id="process"><a class="header" href="#process">Process</a></h2>
<p>Every case goes through the same general process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovery</li>
<li>Investigation</li>
<li>Decision, sometimes with right to an appeal</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-do-we-discover-potential-abuse"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-discover-potential-abuse">How do we discover potential abuse?</a></h3>
<p>From our experience, we learn about potential abuse because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone alerts us. We give abuse reports our full care and attention. Our Support team also responds to every question or comment that comes in. If we notice anything in those emails that points to a violation, we will look into it.</li>
<li>We notice an anomaly in our business operations monitoring. We monitor a range of things about our products, like signup volume and error rates of web requests. If we see something weird with those numbers, we get to the bottom of it.</li>
<li>We stumble upon public web content that links an individual or organization to a Loomio product. We aren’t scouring the Internet looking for those links, but if we do come across any, we check them out.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive; there are always edge cases. We will update the list if we find regular new avenues.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-investigate"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-investigate">How do we investigate?</a></h3>
<p>We focus on the evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language and imagery used by users on the account</li>
<li>Evidence of account users’ power and/or ability to act on spoken claims</li>
<li>Publicly available information about account users</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to balance privacy and safety for all those involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make every effort to complete our investigations without accessing a customer account. For instance, if there are screenshots or public documents available, we review those. We also consider whether it is appropriate to involve the account owner in a given investigation and seek additional evidence from them.</li>
<li>As we review the evidence, we look for indications of existing negative impact. We also assess the severity of any potential negative impact, regardless of intent. When relevant, we look for and follow available guidelines from expert institutions.</li>
<li>If we cannot come to a fair assessment from the information available, we may decide to access a customer account without notice. We do not make this decision lightly. Customer privacy is a big deal to us and we only pursue this course of action if the evidence we have already is very concerning, but not definitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>While some violations are flatly obvious, others are subjective, nuanced, and difficult to adjudicate. We give each case adequate time and attention, commensurate with the violation, criticality, and severity of the charge.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-if-someone-really-broke-the-rules"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-if-someone-really-broke-the-rules">What happens if someone really broke the rules?</a></h3>
<p>We will terminate an account without advance notice if there is evidence it is being used for a restricted purpose that has, is, or will cause severe harm. If applicable, we will also report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>For other cases, we’ll take a case-by-case approach to clear things up.</p>
<p>Further, as a small, privately owned independent business that puts our values and conscience ahead of growth at all costs, we reserve the right to deny service to anyone we ultimately feel uncomfortable doing business with.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-appeal-a-decision"><a class="header" href="#can-you-appeal-a-decision">Can you appeal a decision?</a></h3>
<p>If we terminate an account without notice, the decision is final.</p>
<p>For other cases, we will consider good faith appeals sent to <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a> by the account owner within 14 calendar days.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-policy"><a class="header" href="#privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a></h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-10-08</em></p>
<p>The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled, and your rights to your data.</p>
<p>We promise we never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all services built and maintained by Loomio Limited.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-collect-and-why"><a class="header" href="#what-we-collect-and-why">What we collect and why</a></h2>
<p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice.</p>
<h3 id="identity--access"><a class="header" href="#identity--access">Identity &amp; access</a></h3>
<p>When you sign up for a Loomio product, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company or group name. That’s just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you notices, invoices, updates, or other essential information. We also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.</p>
<h3 id="billing-information"><a class="header" href="#billing-information">Billing information</a></h3>
<p>When you pay for a Loomio product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That’s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your name, billing address, organization name and billing information are handled directly by our subscription management service, and credit card information is handle by our payment processor.</p>
<h3 id="geolocation-data"><a class="header" href="#geolocation-data">Geolocation data</a></h3>
<p>We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.</p>
<p>We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep this record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.</p>
<p>Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases.</p>
<h3 id="website-interactions"><a class="header" href="#website-interactions">Website interactions</a></h3>
<p>When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services.</p>
<h3 id="anti-bot-assessments"><a class="header" href="#anti-bot-assessments">Anti-bot assessments</a></h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> services across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and in Loomio as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your accounts and fill specific forms in Loomio, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to check whether the data is possibly filled out by an automated program instead of a human.</p>

<p>We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics.

<h3 id="voluntary-correspondence"><a class="header" href="#voluntary-correspondence">Voluntary correspondence</a></h3>
<p>When you write Loomio with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.</p>
<p>We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-do-not-collect"><a class="header" href="#information-we-do-not-collect">Information we do not collect</a></h3>
<p>We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.</p>
<p>We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.</p>
<h2 id="when-we-access-or-share-your-information"><a class="header" href="#when-we-access-or-share-your-information">When we access or share your information</a></h2>
<p>Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:</p>
<p><strong>To provide products or services you've requested</strong>. We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use <a href="privacy/loomio-subprocessors/index.html">here</a>. Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. No Loomio human looks at your data for these purposes unless an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them from reoccurring. We also use some other processors for other business functions, which you can view: <a href="privacy/company-processors/index.html">Company processors</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug or support request.</strong> We may need to access your account when you contact us asking for support to resolve a software bug or adminsitative issue.</p>
<p><strong>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding <a href="privacy/../abuse/index.html">restricted uses</a>.</strong> Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p><strong>When required under applicable law.</strong></p>
<p>Loomio Limited, is a New Zealand registered company, however our data infrastructure are located in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<ul>
<li>If law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share or preserve data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a government authority outside New Zealand approaches Loomio with a request, our default stance is to refuse unless the New Zealand government compels us to comply through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement.</li>
<li>If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist. If you are an account owner who wants to export data from their accounts, you can do so directly by following <a href="https://help.loomio.org/en/user_manual/groups/data_export/">these instructions</a>.</li>
<li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if Loomio Limited is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-and-personally-identifiable-information"><a class="header" href="#user-content-and-personally-identifiable-information">User Content and Personally Identifiable Information</a></h2>
<p>As a discussion and decision-making platform, Loomio stores and processes user generated Content; including discussions, comments, proposals, files and images.</p>
<p>We also store and process your “user profile”; including your name, email address, profile photo. This information can make a user personally identifiable, although you can use a pseudonym and anonymous email address to prevent this.</p>
<p>As a member of a Loomio group, your user profile and the content you create or upload to Loomio will be shared with the members of that group. Your email address will only be available to administrators of the group.</p>
<p>Content including your user profile will be public on the internet if you participate in a public discussion or join a public group.</p>
<p>You may view or correct your personal information at any time via the &quot;edit profile&quot; page within Loomio.</p>
<p>You may <em>delete</em> your user account. This will permanently delete your profile information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user account including your name, email address, user id and other personally identifying data will be deleted from our systems.</li>
<li>Comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them.</li>
<li>You will no longer be listed as a member of any groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information"><a class="header" href="#your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information">Your rights with respect to your information</a></h2>
<p>At Loomio, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Loomio recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
<li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Loomio services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li>
<li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
<li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.</p>
<p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">contact@loomio.org</a>. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.</p>
<p>If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-secure-your-data"><a class="header" href="#how-we-secure-your-data">How we secure your data</a></h2>
<p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.</p>
<p>In Loomio most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our <a href="privacy/../security/index.html">security overview</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-data-in-your-product-accounts"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-when-you-delete-data-in-your-product-accounts">What happens when you delete data in your product accounts</a></h2>
<p>We've designed our deletion policy and the features within Loomio based on our experience of supporting a variety of organizations with differing levels of technical competency and trust.</p>
<p>Our design strives to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>. If you write something then want to change or remove it, you can.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>. If you write something then change it, there is a record of the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery</strong> from mistakes and malicious actions. As an admin you can restore accidentally discarded records, and prevent group members from deleting records they should not delete.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and confidence</strong>. If you need something permanently deleted, you can do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to discussions, comments, polls, votes, files and other records that are not user accounts, we have three functions available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discard</strong> will remove the record from view. Discarded records are automatically deleted 90 days after they were discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Restore</strong> can be used to reverse the discard action before the 90 day period has ended, bringing a record back to its normal state.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> will immediately and irreversibly delete a record. When a record is deleted, it cannot be restored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our application database has 4 day point-in-time recovery, meaning that 4 days after you delete a record it has been completely removed from our systems and backups.</p>
<p>If you accidentally delete a record, we do not offer recovery from these backups.</p>
<h2 id="deleting-your-user-account"><a class="header" href="#deleting-your-user-account">Deleting your user account</a></h2>
<p>If you choose to delete your Loomio user account, we will remove your user profile including your user ID, name, email address, profile photo and other known personally identifying information. However, communication history (such as comments and votes) will be kept to preserve the integrity of discussions and decisions within your groups.</p>
<p>If you wish to have comments or other data deleted from a group that you are not an administrator of, you should contact the group administrator and request deletion of that data.</p>
<p>Data deletion requests may be made to the data protection officer via email (dpo@loomio.org). Loomio may delete user data at the request of law enforcement or if personal safety is at risk.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-site-and-data"><a class="header" href="#location-of-site-and-data">Location of site and data</a></h2>
<p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand. If you are using one of our services located outside of the country you reside, <strong>please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the location of the regional service</strong>. By using our service, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<h2 id="when-transferring-personal-data-from-the-eu"><a class="header" href="#when-transferring-personal-data-from-the-eu">When transferring personal data from the EU</a></h2>
<p>The GDPR requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that the EU privacy laws grant. Loomio has offered a data processing addendum.</p>
<p>We have incorporated a Data Processing Addendum to our <a href="privacy/../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a> that is in effect when the GDPR applies to your use of Loomio Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (both controller-processor and controller-controller) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. The DPA is extensive so to aid our customers, we have provided both a summary of what they mean and how Loomio Limited upholds our responsibilities in our <a href="privacy/regulations/index.html">Privacy Regulation Reference</a>. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">contact us</a> to request a signed DPA with your organization name, and name and email address of the person with authority to sign on behalf of your organization. Regardless of whether you execute or not, we protect and secure your data to the high standards set out in the addendum.</p>
<p>There are also a few ad-hoc cases where EU personal data may be transferred to the US related to Loomio Limited operations. Such transfers are only occasional and transferred under the <a href="https://gdpr-info.eu/art-49-gdpr/">Article 49(1)(b) derogation</a> under GDPR.</p>

<p><em>Last updated: 2021-11-03</em></p>
<p>The data privacy regulatory landscape is undergoing a lot of change. You probably have heard about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25, 2018. There are also other regulations in effect or in the works around the world. We’ve written up this reference document to put helpful information regarding our products and privacy regulations in one place. Please also view our full <a href="privacy/regulations/../index.html">Privacy policy</a>.</p>

<h2 id="european-union-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr"><a class="header" href="#european-union-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is a New Zealand registered company, however our data infrastructure is located in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand. That means your data is transferred to the country where the data infrastructure is resident. The EU has strong privacy laws and a core tenet of the GDPR is that if you transfer any personal data of EU residents out of the EU, you must protect it to the same level as guaranteed under EU law. There are two factors to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The practices that businesses take handling personal data; and</li>
<li>The laws of the countries where you transfer the EU personal data to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practices-we-have-at-loomio"><a class="header" href="#practices-we-have-at-loomio">Practices we have at Loomio</a></h3>
<p>We are serious about treating our customers fairly. We respect your privacy and will never sell your data to third parties, nor put advertising into Loomio. You have control of your data and right to privacy. The security measures we put in place are to protect your personal data. These principles apply to all of our customers, regardless of where you are in the world.</p>
<p>Please read our <a href="privacy/regulations/../index.html">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="privacy/regulations/../../security/index.html">Security Overview</a> in full. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>We never have and never will sell customer data.</li>
<li>We don’t run ads for other services in our products.</li>
<li>We limit the data we collect: if we don’t need it, we don’t ask for it.</li>
<li>We limit the permissions our apps request on your devices.</li>
<li>We put a lot of security measures into place including in-transit encryption, encryption at-rest, and requiring employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements.</li>
<li>When you email us at <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.org">contact@loomio.org</a>, someone from our team will get back to you. You are always speaking with a human! No bots.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do work with sub-processors. You can see a list of current sub-processors at <a href="privacy/regulations/../loomio-subprocessors/index.html">Loomio Subprocessors</a> and <a href="privacy/regulations/../company-processors/index.html">Company Processors</a>. With each vendor, we assess their commitment to privacy and ensure they have GDPR-compliant data processing agreements in place that include the controller-processor <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">Standard Contractual Clauses</a>.</p>
<h3 id="data-processing-addendum"><a class="header" href="#data-processing-addendum">Data processing addendum</a></h3>
<p>We have incorporated a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) to our <a href="privacy/regulations/../../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a>. You can find the DPA linked within the Uptime, Security and Privacy section. This addendum is in effect when the General Data Protection Regulation applies to your use of Loomio services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (both controller-processor and controller-controller) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">contact us</a> to request a signed DPA with your organization name, and name and email address of the person with authority to sign on behalf of your organization. We provide the same privacy rights and protection to all customers, regardless of whether they choose to execute a DPA. </p>
<h2 id="california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa"><a class="header" href="#california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a></h2>
<p>In the CCPA, there is an important distinction between what are referred to as “service providers”, “businesses”, and “third parties”. You can see how the regulation defines these words by visiting the California Attorney General’s website: https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa.</p>
<p><em>Under the CCPA, Loomio is a “service provider.”</em> That means when we process data you provide, we do so solely for the purpose you signed up for. Our business model is simple: we charge a recurring subscription fee to our customers. We do not sell personal information or use your data for any other commercial purposes unless with your explicit permission.</p>
<p>The CCPA also grants residents of California with additional rights related to their information. We grant those rights to all of our customers and detail them in our Privacy policy. Our Privacy policy also explains the information we collect in order to provide our services and clearly lists the only times we access or share your data.</p>

<p>At any time, you can also choose to accelerate your journey towards more effective and efficient outcomes with your group with the following package:</p>
<h2 id="group-training"><a class="header" href="#group-training">Group training</a></h2>
<p>Tailored training to suit your organization’s needs.  Our group training starts by understanding your unique group needs, the current tools and processes your group use, so as to implement Loomio in the most useful way.</p>
<p>We then agree to a schedule of 2 x 60 minute online sessions to give your users confidence and mastery in achieving success with Loomio.</p>
<p>As your experience with Loomio builds, 1-2 follow up sessions are scheduled within the next 90 days to lift your use of Loomio and get more out of your tool in your environment.</p>
<h3 id="the-typical-package"><a class="header" href="#the-typical-package">The typical package</a></h3>
<p>Phase 1: Scoping. A half-hour session by teleconference (e.g. Zoom) to understand your organization needs in more detail, and map the ecosystem of digital and nondigital tools and processes you currently use to organize, communicate, record, &amp; decide with your group.</p>
<p>Phase 2: Implementation and training workshops to build confidence to introduce Loomio to your group (2 x 60 minute online sessions).</p>
<ul>
<li>The first session is typically for administrators and group coordinators to configure your Loomio group, set up first discussion threads, polls and proposals for initial engagement, and learn how to manage group members.</li>
<li>The second session can either be to assist you to introduce Loomio to your group users, or to dive deeper into Loomio features that can help administrators. The goal is for attendees to develop confidence and mastery in achieving outcomes with Loomio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Phase 3: Follow up workshops (one or two 30 minute online sessions), typically scheduled within 90 days. Workshops typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your experience of Loomio thus far, focusing on how well Loomio is integrating with your processes. Responding to questions arising and feedback from group members.</li>
<li>Adapting and further developing processes and refreshing use of Loomio features (or introducing newly developed features).</li>
<li>Mapping a path forwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Online workshops are usually recorded so a video is made available for your review and to share with people who couldn’t join the workshop.</p>
<p><em>Also available:</em> In-person workshops for customers in New Zealand and Australia by arrangement. These will be at a location of your choosing and highly tailored to your needs. There may be additional costs with this package, especially for travel, and we’re happy to discuss a plan that makes the most sense for you.</p>

<p><em>How to upgrade, manage or cancel your Loomio subscription.</em></p>
<h2 id="introduction"><a class="header" href="#introduction">Introduction</a></h2>
<p>Loomio uses Chargify billing and subscription management service to manage subscription records, initiate payments, process upgrades and cancellations.</p>
<p>Prices are based on debit/credit card payment via an automated billing portal.</p>
<h2 id="upgrading-your-group"><a class="header" href="#upgrading-your-group">Upgrading your group</a></h2>
<p>To continue to use Loomio beyond your free trial, you can upgrade your group to a paid subscription plan.</p>
<p>You may upgrade your group at any time by clicking the <strong>VIEW PLANS</strong> button.</p>
<p><img src="subscriptions/management/view-plans.png" alt="The View plans button" /></p>
<p>Choose the right plan for your organization's needs and click the <strong>BUY NOW</strong> button.</p>
<p>In the billing portal complete the required fields to set up your subscription with your credit or debit card, including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Customer Information (name and email address)</li>
<li>Billing Information (credit or debit card details)</li>
<li>Billing Address (to insure sales taxes are applied correctly)</li>
<li>Confirm details and click the <strong>Place My Order</strong> button.</li>
</ul>
<p>The subscription is activated immediately and the group automatically upgraded. A tax invoice/statement confirming successful payment will be sent to your email address.</p>
<h2 id="automatic-payment-and-statement-generation"><a class="header" href="#automatic-payment-and-statement-generation">Automatic payment and statement generation</a></h2>
<p>Your credit or debit card details are held securely by Chargify, our subscription management service provider, for future recurring payments.  Chargify is PCI DSS Level 1 Compliant.</p>
<p>Monthly or annual payments via Chargify are automatic, and an invoice/statement is issued on successful payment.</p>
<p>You can access statements, and update card and contact details at any time by visiting <strong>Manage payment details</strong> in your group Settings, or using the secure <strong>Account Management</strong> link at the bottom of your statement.</p>
<h2 id="billing-problems"><a class="header" href="#billing-problems">Billing problems</a></h2>
<p>Chargify may be unable to process a payment to your card when due.</p>
<p>If a payment is unsuccessful, an email notification will be sent to the email address we have on file, along with a link to the billing portal where you can update card details. The billing system will continue to retry the payment once a week, and if payment is not successful after four (4) attempts, the subscription plan will be cancelled (day 28).</p>
<p>Card payment problems are often caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient funds</li>
<li>Expired card</li>
<li>Bank restrictions on new cards or changes to existing cards. Please make sure your credit or debit card is authorized for “international payments” and “internet transactions” (“Prch” and “Auth”).</li>
</ul>
<p>The billing system will issue an alert via email when your credit card is nearing expiry.</p>
