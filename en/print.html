<h2 id="how-loomio-works"><a class="header" href="#how-loomio-works">How Loomio works</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is designed to help your group come together, discuss in threads and use polls to make decisions.  It has a simple structure of three main elements; Group, Threads and Polls. </p>
<h3 id="group"><a class="header" href="#group">Group</a></h3>
<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/Groups.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group home</strong></p>
<p>Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help group members participate.</p>
<h3 id="threads"><a class="header" href="#threads">Threads</a></h3>
<p>Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/Threads.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>Threads are used for many purposes; to prepare for a meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on proposals, approve actions, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a shared understanding of important issues.</p>
<p>Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organization’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<h3 id="polls"><a class="header" href="#polls">Polls</a></h3>
<p>Loomio includes a wide range of poll tools to help you progress a discussion to an outcome. Each poll type has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. </p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/Proposals.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>proposal</strong> is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask members of your group to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree</li>
<li>abstain or </li>
<li>disagree. </li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. </p>
<p>A proposal, and associated discussion, helps your group build shared understanding and creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>
<h3 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h3>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/key_concept_1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Use your own group or:</p>
<ul>
<li>see the <a href="https://www.loomio.com/demo">demo</a></li>
<li>start a <a href="https://www.loomio.com/g/new">free trial</a></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="group-page"><a class="header" href="#group-page">Group page</a></h2>
<p>Your group home page is the first place people see when they arrive. It contains a description of why the group exists, what you will use it for, and any other information that may help you participate.</p>
<p>Administrators can edit the description, add an image and logo that represents your organization, set and change group privacy and member permissions.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/group_page_home.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="tabs"><a class="header" href="#tabs">Tabs</a></h3>
<p>Under the group description you will see tabs. Clicking on each tab displays information about:</p>
<p><strong>Threads</strong> - A list of discussion threads showing the author, the thread title, category tag, along with some other useful information about recent activity in the thread. </p>
<p><strong>Polls</strong> - A list of polls active in your group.</p>
<p><strong>Members</strong> - Where you can see a list of the people who are members of the group.</p>
<p><strong>Files</strong> - Files and documents that have been attached to threads in your group.</p>
<p><strong>Subgroups</strong> - A list of subgroups that you are a member of. A subgroup is the collaborative space for a working team, project or event, a governance board, a subcommittee or stakeholders group.</p>
<p>Below the tabs there is a search bar where you can type in any key word to find a particular thread. To the left are drop down menus where you can filter thread view to see open or closed threads, or view threads by category tag.</p>
<p>If the threads tab is selected, the thread list shows the title of the thread, author, number of replies, and when last active.</p>
<h2 id="side-bar"><a class="header" href="#side-bar">Side bar</a></h2>
<p>The sidebar menu is accessible from the (☰) menu icon at screen top left, where you can see:</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/sidebar_menu_janus.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dashboard</strong> - Open polls and recently active threads.</li>
<li><strong>Unread threads</strong> - A list of threads you have yet to read.</li>
<li><strong>Invite-only threads</strong> - Private threads that do not belong to a group.</li>
<li><strong>Start a new thread</strong> - Where you can start a new thread. </li>
<li><strong>Tasks</strong> - A list of tasks assigned to you, with due date.</li>
<li><strong>Your Loomio groups</strong> - Where you can easily find your Loomio groups and subgroups.</li>

<p>The bell icon in the top-right is where notifications are accessed within Loomio.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/notifications_demo.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="email-notifications"><a class="header" href="#email-notifications">Email notifications</a></h3>
<p>Loomio sends emails to keep you updated on the activity in your groups. </p>
<p>Emails Loomio may send you include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mention and Replies</strong> - When someone @mentions you in a comment or replies to you, you will receive a notification email.</li>
<li><strong>Subscribe on participation</strong> - If selected, when you participate in a thread you will receive emails for all further activity. This is off by default because in a busy group it can generate a lot of emails.</li>
<li><strong>Catch-up summary email</strong> - The 'Yesterday on Loomio' email includes activity from all your groups and threads that you have not read yet, and is a useful way to stay in touch with what's happening without having to visit Loomio every day.</li>
<li><strong>Invitations to threads and polls</strong> - You may receive an email when invited to a new thread or poll.</li>
<li><strong>Reminders and Outcomes</strong> - If you have not voted in a poll, you may receive a reminder 24 hours before close. You may also receive an email stating the outcome of a poll.</li>
</ul>
<p>These emails are to help you participate effectively with your group. The default settings are to help you stay up to date with activity on Loomio but should not overload your email inbox.</p>
<p>If you are receiving too many emails from Loomio, you can change the default email settings. Talk to your group administrator to get the balance right for you.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/email_settings_full.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you receive an email from Loomio, you can reply directly from your email inbox and your reply will be posted into the Loomio thread. This works for everything except the Catch-up summary email.</p>
<h2 id="finding-information-quickly"><a class="header" href="#finding-information-quickly">Finding information quickly</a></h2>
<p>There are several tools included within Loomio to help you find the information you are looking for quickly.</p>
<h3 id="search"><a class="header" href="#search">Search</a></h3>
<p>You can use the Search bar at the top of almost every page to search for content relevant to that page.</p>
<p>For example, on the threads page typing 'strategy' in the search bar brings up threads with the word 'strategy'.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/search_strategy.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="category-tags"><a class="header" href="#category-tags">Category Tags</a></h3>
<p>Category Tags make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic. </p>

</ul>
<h3 id="thread-context"><a class="header" href="#thread-context">Thread context</a></h3>
<p>The thread context is used to introduce the topic. It will often include background information to help you participate in the discussion, such as attached files or links to online documents. The context always stays at the top of the thread.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/thread_context_example.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>

<p>To fix this: Sign out then sign in again with the email address you normally use Loomio with.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? This can happen because you participated in a poll when you were not signed in; Loomio creates a guest user, so you can participate without signing in. When you sign in later, we confirm the authenticity of your vote and connect it to your registered user.</p>

<p>There are many types of polls. The example below shows a typical proposal with voting options of <strong>Agree</strong>, <strong>Abstain</strong> or <strong>Disagree</strong>. Other options may be available.</p>
<p>Read the poll, and any attached files, then cast your vote by selecting one of the options.</p>

<p><img src="user_manual/getting_started/results.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>In a controversial proposal it is common to see mixed results, however this does not mean the proposal has failed.</p>
<p>Often the new information revealed during the proposal helps form a better proposal that is more likely to pass.</p>
<h3 id="outcome"><a class="header" href="#outcome">Outcome</a></h3>
<p>When the proposal closes, the author is prompted to state the <strong>Outcome</strong>.</p>

<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for people to meet, have discussions and make decisions. </p>
<p>It’s a container where group members can find and share information, participate in important discussions and decisions that affect their work.</p>
<p>A Loomio group looks like this.  At the top of the page you will see an image and logo that you can tailor to represent your organization.  This allows people arriving into your group to see they have joined a place they recognize and feel welcome - a safe space where people feel at home, amongst friends and can participate effectively.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/groups/intro_to_groups/group_page.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Choose a representative name for your group and use the group description to outline;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>what</strong> this group is used for,</li>
<li><strong>why</strong> this is important,</li>
<li><strong>who</strong> is involved, and</li>
<li><strong>how</strong> members can participate.</li>
</ul>
<p>You may also include information like a code of conduct, terms of reference or other governing documents for the group.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="starting-a-new-group"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-new-group">Starting a new group</a></h1>
<p>If you are new to Loomio, you can start a group on a free trial at any time from the <a href="https://www.loomio.com/">Loomio website</a>.</p>
<p>For many organizations, a single Loomio group is sufficient. You can start as many subgroups as you need within the group. See <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/subgroups/index.html">Subgroups</a> for more info.</p>
<p>If you already use Loomio and would like to start a new group for another organization or purpose, you can do this from the sidebar menu - click on <strong>New group</strong>.</p>
<p>A new Loomio group starts a new free trial and you will be invited to upgrade the trial to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>If you are a Pro plan customer, we can add your group to your Pro plan subscription. <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">Contact us</a> to connect your new group to your Pro plan subscription account.</p>

<p>Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join.</p>
<p>The recommended privacy setting for new groups is <strong>Secret</strong>. This means everything is private to those invited members of the group. No one will know about this group (or subgroup) unless you invite them.</p>
<p>If you want the content of your discussions and decisions to be public and accessible by anyone on the internet, change your group privacy to <strong>Open</strong>. The members list will only be visible to other members.</p>
<p>Many groups use <strong>Closed</strong> to allow people to find the group and request to join. The <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Group description</strong> are publicly accessible in Closed groups, but all threads are private.</p>
<p>Open groups may contain secret and closed subgroups.</p>
<p>A member of an open group can see that a closed subgroup exists, but not secret subgroups.</p>

<h2 id="permissions"><a class="header" href="#permissions">Permissions</a></h2>
<p>There are two levels of membership a person can have to a group: admin and member. </p>
<p>Admins can edit group settings, make other people admins, and perform all the actions listed below.</p>
<p>Consider carefully each of these permissions and how they apply to your group.  In general groups with trusted members experienced with Loomio will have most settings ticked. However for most new groups, communities and larger networks, where people are less familiar with Loomio, you may want to restrict permissions to keep everyone safe.  You can always open permissions as confidence and experience of the group increases.</p>
<p>Contact us if you have questions about the best permission settings for your group.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/groups/settings/settings_permissions.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="members-can-invite-members"><a class="header" href="#members-can-invite-members">Members can invite members</a></h3>

<h3 id="members-can-invite-guests"><a class="header" href="#members-can-invite-guests">Members can invite guests</a></h3>
<p>Allows anyone in your group to invite a guest into a particular thread or poll in the group.  A guest can only see and participate in the thread or poll they are invited to - they cannot see other threads or polls in the group.</p>
<p>For example a board may want to invite their accountant to participate in a discussion about a financial report, so invites the accountant to the particular thread.</p>
<h3 id="members-can-notify-everyone-in-group"><a class="header" href="#members-can-notify-everyone-in-group">Members can notify everyone in group</a></h3>

<h3 id="oldest-or-newest-first"><a class="header" href="#oldest-or-newest-first">Oldest or Newest first</a></h3>
<p>Threads set to <strong>Oldest</strong> display comments top to bottom from oldest to newest.  New comments start at the bottom of the thread.</p>
<p>You can reverse thread view with <strong>Newest</strong> so that the new comments start at the top of the thread.  This is useful for 'wall' threads, for example a thread used for posting regular reports.</p>
<h3 id="flat-or-nested-replies"><a class="header" href="#flat-or-nested-replies">Flat or Nested replies</a></h3>
<p>The thread can also be set to display chronologically, as a <strong>flat list</strong>, where all activity is displayed in the order that it happened, or as <strong>nested replies</strong> of one or two levels. </p>
<p>Nested replies keeps replies to comments together, and is very helpful to easily see mini-discussions within an overall thread.</p>

<p>Inviting people to join your Loomio group is a critical step to success - however everyone is busy; many people are reluctant to try a new tool and can be slow to respond to your invitation.</p>
<p>Loomio includes tools to help you invite people; but you may also need to reach out to members by phone, text, chat or in a meeting, to tell them <em><strong>why</strong></em> you are using Loomio. If your group members resonate with this, it will encourage them to give it a go.</p>
<p>For example, your group might need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a safe space where members can find all the info they need and participate in their own time</li>
<li>to stay in touch and respond to issues that come up between meetings </li>
<li>to progress discussions and make decisions as needed</li>
<li>to have better meetings and focus precious meeting time on issues that matter</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still having trouble with people not accepting your invitation: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="user_manual/groups/membership/index.html#re-send-invitations">Re-send your invitation</a>.</li>
<li>Invite them to a particular thread or poll using their email address (so they can see that things are happening). Their email reply or vote will appear in Loomio.</li>
<li>Record a short video of yourself on your phone, Zoom or Loom and send this with your invitation; so people can see that you're a real person, the importance of the work, your enthusiasm and passion, and to encourage them to join in :-)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="invite-people"><a class="header" href="#invite-people">Invite people</a></h2>
<p>Go to your group page and click the <strong>Members</strong> tab to access member management</p>
<p>You can <strong>Invite</strong> particular people to your group with their email address or <strong>Share</strong> a link to your group via email, newsletter, chat or from your website.</p>

<p>If the recipient already has a Loomio user account they can still accept the invitation to join your group with their existing account.</p>

<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tip</strong>: Copy email addresses from a column in a Google or Excel spreadsheet, and paste into the invitation box.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>When you click <strong>Invite</strong> an email will be sent to each of the email addresses you supplied, containing a unique invitation link that can only be used once. This email will be sent in your current language.</p>

<p>Following the same process as above, you can invite people to a 'parent' group, and one or more subgroups simultaneously when you invite them with the <strong>Invite people</strong> button. Tick the boxes next to the subgroups you want them to immediately be a part of when they join the group.</p>
<h2 id="share-a-link-to-your-group"><a class="header" href="#share-a-link-to-your-group">Share a link to your group</a></h2>
<p>You can share a link to your group with the <strong>Share</strong> button. This is useful if you want to send a link via email, newsletter, chat or post on your website.</p>
<p>Two options are provided:</p>
<p><strong>Group URL</strong> is the address for your group. Only invited members will be able to see the group. Useful to remind people that you have previously invited. </p>
<p><strong>Reusable invitation link</strong> will allow anyone with the link to join your group without your approval.  Share this only within private communications to allow people in your organization to join.</p>

<p>There are only two user types in a Loomio group; <strong>member</strong> and <strong>admin</strong>. </p>
<p>Admins perform administrative tasks for your group including; add and remove members, make and remove admin permissions, change group privacy and member permission settings, upgrade and manage subscription plans.</p>
<p>The person creating a new Loomio group is made admin by default. We recommend to make at least one other person in your group admin, to insure someone can always administer your group. </p>
<p>Admins are people you trust to administer your group. You can have as many admins in your group as you wish.</p>
<p>To make a member <strong>admin</strong>, go to the Members tab, find the member and click on the three dots (<strong>⋮</strong>) next to their name. Choose <strong>Make admin</strong>. An <code>Admin</code> tag will appear beside their name.</p>

<p>Subgroups help you organize your communications and members so that the right people are engaged in their work together.</p>
<p>For example, you can use subgroups for your organization's</p>
<ul>
<li>governance board</li>
<li>working team or a project working group</li>
<li>a topic (such as 'strategy' or 'learning')</li>
</ul>
<p>Subgroups work just like groups do, but are located within your &quot;parent&quot; group. Most of the features and settings are the same as what you encounter in your parent group. This also means that someone can be a member of your subgroup, such as your board, but not of your parent group.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#add-a-subgroup">Add a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>To add a subgroup in your group, go to the <strong>Subgroups</strong> tab.</p>

<h3 id="privacy-1"><a class="header" href="#privacy-1">Privacy</a></h3>
<p>The privacy settings for subgroups are similar to the parent group. </p>
<p><strong>Secret</strong> subgroups are not visible to people not invited to the subgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Closed</strong> subgroups are listed in the Subgroups tab of the parent group and user's sidebar menu. Members of the parent group can request to join the subgroup. Membership is approved by a subgroup admin.</p>
<p>Closed subgroups have an additional setting that allow members of its parent group to see private threads.</p>

<h3 id="permissions-1"><a class="header" href="#permissions-1">Permissions</a></h3>
<p>Subgroups operate independently of the main group. For example, if the subgroup privacy setting is set to <strong>Secret</strong>, then only invited members can find this subgroup, see who is in it, and see threads.</p>
<p>Closed subgroups have an additional setting that allow members of its parent group to see private threads, enabling the subgroup to be transparent to members of the parent group.</p>

<h2 id="administer-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#administer-subgroup">Administer subgroup</a></h2>
<p>Subgroups can have their own admins, and admins of a subgroup may not be the same as the admins of the parent group.</p>
<p>However an admin of the 'parent' group can make themselves admin of any subgroups.  This helps administrators of the parent group to administer subgroups as necessary.</p>
<p>Go to the subgroup and click <strong>Join group</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/groups/subgroups/subgroup_join.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Now a member of the subgroup, an admin of the parent group can make themselves an admin of the subgroup.</p>

<h2 id="archive-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#archive-a-subgroup">Archive a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>When your subgroup has served its purpose and you want to keep the subgroup for your records, a subgroup admin can archive it with the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Rename the subgroup by appending the word Archive, e.g. <strong>Archive - subgroup name</strong>.</li>
<li>Update the subgroup description to let everyone know the subgroup is now closed/archived.</li>
<li>Remove members of the subgroup, leaving at least one person as admin.  (Only subgroup members can write new content.)</li>
</ul>
<p>If you want the archived subgroup to be visible to members of the parent group; </p>
<ul>
<li>Change subgroup privacy to <strong>Closed</strong></li>
<li>In <strong>Permissions</strong> check the first box allowing members of the parent group to see the group.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="delete-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#delete-a-subgroup">Delete a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>Admins can delete a subgroup in the same way you delete group. When deleting a subgroup, be careful to not delete the 'parent' group.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intro-to-threads"><a class="header" href="#intro-to-threads">Intro to Threads</a></h1>
<p>Loomio threads are where you can share information, discuss topics, and make decisions with your group.  People participate by posting comments and replies.</p>
<ul>
<li>All info about a topic is in one easily accessible place.</li>
<li>People can reply via email and their comments appear in the thread.</li>
<li>You can see who has read the thread and who needs a nudge.</li>
<li>There is a record of discussion you can easily find again.</li>
</ul>
<p>Threads have a wide range of uses; from a general discussion forum to running specific work-flow and decision-making processes.</p>
<p>For example, you may facilitate an open discussion on a topic, inviting people to contribute their thoughts and opinions, and progress the discussion towards an agreed outcome.</p>
<p>Or you may invite people to participate in a particular decision, using a consent or advice decision-making process.</p>
<p>Threads can also contain polls and proposals to help progress a discussion to an outcome. As people comment in the thread and vote in polls, a thread timeline builds so you can easily find key milestones.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/intro_to_threads/intro_to_thread.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="using-threads"><a class="header" href="#using-threads">Using threads</a></h3>

<h2 id="set-up-thread"><a class="header" href="#set-up-thread">Set up thread</a></h2>
<p>The thread set up page has two tabs:</p>

<h3 id="content-tab"><a class="header" href="#content-tab">Content tab</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> Check the name of the group is correct.  Anyone in this group will be able to see the thread. You can also start the thread in another group or as an 'Invite-only' thread (no group).</p>
<p><strong>Tags:</strong>  Add tag(s) to help people find your thread when searching by tag.  Admins can create new tags. </p>
<p><strong>Notify:</strong> You can use notify to send the thread to the people you wish.  Use the drop down menu to select a group of people, and click on the group to see individual people.  You can then remove people </p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/starting_threads/thread_notification.png#width-80" alt="thread notification" /></p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Give your thread a relevant title.  A thread title is similar to an email subject line.</p>
<p><strong>Context:</strong> Use thread context to introduce the topic and frame the conversation or decision to make. Include background information, attach files, link to online documents and embed a video. Let people know what you expect. </p>
<p>The context will always stay at the top of the thread and you can update it at any time as the discussion progresses.  When the discussion ends, update the context with the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="thread-privacy"><a class="header" href="#thread-privacy">Thread privacy</a></h2>
<p>If your group privacy is <strong>Closed</strong> or <strong>Secret</strong> then your threads will be <strong>private</strong>. Private means that only members of the group are able to view the threads started in this group (<em>except</em> when you <strong>invite people</strong> such as an expert or any guest not currently part of your group).</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/starting_threads/thread_private.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If your group is &quot;Open&quot; then all your threads will be public, meaning that anyone with the URL can view the thread.</p>

<p><em>Catalyze interactions.</em></p>
<p>Effective use of Loomio means knowing how and when to get attention from the group, group members, and even external people your group wants to engage in Loomio to keep everything in one place.</p>
<p>If you ask for attention when it's really important, and avoid it when it's not, people will keep paying attention.</p>
<h2 id="within-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#within-a-thread">Within a thread</a></h2>
<h3 id="mentioning-people"><a class="header" href="#mentioning-people">Mentioning people</a></h3>
<p>If you want to get the attention of a specific person, type <strong>@</strong>, start typing their name, and then select the user you want to <strong>mention</strong>. Click post or start. You can mention people in comments, threads, or even decisions. They will be notified that you’ve mentioned them.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VzM1AWnNP7c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h3 id="replies"><a class="header" href="#replies">Replies</a></h3>
<p>When you reply to a comment, you will notify the user you replied to. Find the <strong>reply</strong> button on the bottom of the comment to which you wish to associate your reply (it will indented or nested under the comment you replied to, by default).</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/notifying_people/reply.png" alt="where to click reply on a comment" /></p>
<p><em>Note: You can also <a href="user_manual/threads/notifying_people/../engaging_with_threads/#comments-and-replies">reply to yourself</a>, but it does not send a notification.</em></p>
<h3 id="reactions-1"><a class="header" href="#reactions-1">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>On any comment or thread's context you can <strong><a href="user_manual/threads/notifying_people//en/user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/#reactions">react</a></strong> to quickly respond with an apt emoji.</p>
<p>Reactions send a notification within Loomio, but do not send an email.</p>
<h3 id="start-a-decision"><a class="header" href="#start-a-decision">Start a decision</a></h3>
<p>The most powerful way to get attention from your group. Ensure that you have a clear decision description so people know how to participate. Loomio will notify everyone you choose (the whole group, everyone in the thread, or selected individuals) about new decisions, <em>although you can choose not to notify people and let them find it on their own time.</em></p>
<h2 id="starting-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-thread">Starting a thread</a></h2>
<h3 id="notify"><a class="header" href="#notify">Notify</a></h3>
<p>When you start a discussion, you can choose to select all members of a group, or a select number of them. When you select the whole group, you can assume it will get everyone's attention. People you invite will get a notification immediately.</p>
<p>You can also invite guests now (or later, as described just below).</p>
<h3 id="invite-people-1"><a class="header" href="#invite-people-1">Invite People</a></h3>
<p>When you start a thread, your whole group can access it immediately. If you want more people's participation, or want their participation sooner, you can additionally send them an alert via the box that immediately appears when you start the thread. You can also alert people in this way later on via the <strong><a href="user_manual/threads/notifying_people//en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin/#invite-guests-to-thread">members</a></strong> button at the thread context's bottom. Exactly like <strong>notify</strong>, invited parties will immediately receive a notification.</p>
<p>If, for example, the thread is an important announcement and contains information that's ready for the whole group to take notice of, then <strong>notify</strong> them when you start the thread.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> <em>We've made it quick to select all of the members of the relevant group; click the link with your group's name.</em></p>
<p>Use <strong>invite people</strong> to invite guests or experts from outside your group to a specific thread; <a href="user_manual/threads/notifying_people/../thread_admin/#invite-guests-to-thread">learn more</a>.</p>
<h3 id="notify-the-right-people-every-time"><a class="header" href="#notify-the-right-people-every-time">Notify the right people every time</a></h3>
<p>Subgroups are a great way to make it simple to send notifications to a specific set of people. If I click <strong>invite people</strong> from a thread in a subgroup, I can simply select <strong>Members of <code>Subgroup Name</code></strong>.</p>
<p>It's great to remind your working group when there hasn't been much interaction with a thread. To increase the chances of good engagement, check that the thread context and title include a clear invitation, specifying how to participate.</p>

<p><em>Comments and tools such as thread translation and thread emails.</em></p>
<h2 id="thread-context-1"><a class="header" href="#thread-context-1">Thread context</a></h2>
<p>The thread <strong>context</strong> has special status within a thread. It's always at the top, and it's always visible on the page.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/context_panel.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Like a comment, you can format your text and attach files or images. Unlike a comment, anyone in the group can update the context (and the title of the thread) by default. This means you can enable anyone to pitch in and help keep things easy to understand and easy to find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> As the thread grows, update the context with key understandings and information so new people can catch up and participate easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context is like the whiteboard in your meeting room, where you can write the agenda, the hopeful outcomes and how you aim to get there, and take group notes. <em>Learn more about preparing threads and groups for success <a href="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads//en/guides/facilitators_guide">in our Facilitator's Guide</a>.</em></p>

<h2 id="formatting"><a class="header" href="#formatting">Formatting</a></h2>
<p>Use the formatting tools underneath the space in which you write (any form). Hover the mouse/cursor over each item to know what it is. There's a number of format options listed below, and a few are explained in more detail further down.</p>
<ul>
<li>stylize (bold, italics, code block…)</li>
<li>create lists (eg, checklists)</li>
<li>turn text into hyperlinks - <em>links icon</em></li>
<li>add attachments (from your device) - <em>paper clip icon</em></li>

</ul>
<h3 id="link-to-a-google-doc"><a class="header" href="#link-to-a-google-doc">Link to a Google doc</a></h3>
<p>You can add a link to a Google doc in Loomio anywhere there is a text space; when starting a thread or poll, writing a comment, or updating your group description. The link icon is one of the formatting tools under the space you can write text in Loomio.</p>
<p>To use the link feature, </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the text you want to link to - say the name of a document</li>
<li>Click the link icon</li>
<li>Find the document link - go to your Google drive and ‘Get link’, or go to the Google doc and ‘Share link’.  Check the link permissions so members can open the link - usually ‘Anyone with the link’. Copy the link to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Now, go back to Loomio and paste the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>A preview of the doc will appear under the text space. You can remove this if you want.</p>
<p>Now, anyone with access to your Loomio thread and permission to view the doc can open and read it.</p>

<h3 id="embed-videos"><a class="header" href="#embed-videos">Embed videos</a></h3>
<p>You can embed a video from popular video platforms like Youtube and Vimeo into Loomio anywhere there is a text space; when starting a thread or poll, writing a comment, or updating your group description. The embed video icon is one of the formatting tools, under the space where you write text in Loomio.</p>
<p>To use the embed video feature, </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the embed video icon</li>
<li>Go to the video you want to embed, find and copy the shareable link </li>
<li>Now, go back to Loomio and paste the link</li>
</ol>
<p>A preview of the video will appear.</p>
<p>Now, anyone with access to your Loomio thread and permission to view the video can play it from within Loomio.</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gbWUCPzxTUQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure you set the visibility of the video in Youtube or Vimeo so that the people you want to can view it. In Youtube 'Unlisted' is a good option if you do not want to make the video public.</p>
<h3 id="markdown"><a class="header" href="#markdown">Markdown</a></h3>
<p>To revert to markdown editing, click <strong>M↓</strong>. <em>If you click this while there is text in the form, some formatting may be lost upon conversion.</em></p>

<h2 id="comments-and-replies"><a class="header" href="#comments-and-replies">Comments and replies</a></h2>
<p>The most common activity in a thread is commenting. Comments are shared with everyone in the thread – usually this is just the members of your group. First look for <strong>Comment</strong> and your user photo (or initials).</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/comments_and_facilitation_box.png" alt="" />
<em>Make sure that Comment is highlighted, not Proposal or Poll.</em></p>
<p>Write your comment and press <strong>Post</strong> to have your say.</p>
<p>Replies are like comments except in that the author of the original comment will be notified of your reply. Click <strong>reply</strong> on the comment you would like to associate your comment with, as it will be nested underneath theirs – by default – in the thread in which you replied.</p>
<p>You can reply to your <em>own</em> comment in order to nest your reply underneath the comment. Click the three horizontal dots (<strong>⋯</strong>) to find <strong>reply</strong> in this case.</p>
<p>If Loomio has emailed you a comment and says you can reply to the email, you can reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.</p>
<h2 id="editing-comments"><a class="header" href="#editing-comments">Editing comments</a></h2>
<p>If you've made a typo, or want to add a bit more information to your comment shortly after you've posted it, click <strong>edit</strong> on your comment. Editing does not take anyone else's attention with notifications nor unread signals.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/edit_comment.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Changes you've made will be visible <em>to others</em> via the <strong>edited</strong> button, so you can see what people have changed in their comment.</p>

<p><img src="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/comment_history_modal.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you have new information or are coming back after an extended period of time, just make a new comment, then people who have already read your comment will see that there is new information.</p>
<h2 id="reactions-2"><a class="header" href="#reactions-2">Reactions</a></h2>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/reactions.png" alt="" />
Click <strong>react</strong> on any thread context or comment to share how a comment made you feel, or acknowledge something someone has said, without writing a comment. They're a light-weight way to participate without interrupting the conversation, and they only send a notification within the app (not by email).</p>

<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZI_ZxJKoiy0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Loomio can translate user content (eg, votes, comments…) from one language into another automatically (with the help of Google Translate). If the author of a comment uses a language other than yours, <strong>Translate comment</strong> will be available in the drop-down options of the comment in question, from the three horizontal dots (<strong>⋯</strong>).</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="tasks"><a class="header" href="#tasks">Tasks</a></h1>
<p>Tasks are a new feature of Loomio. The intention is to add support within threads to name and assign actions (or tasks) to people, and track their progress.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-task"><a class="header" href="#add-a-task">Add a task</a></h2>
<p>When you are writing a comment or thread on Loomio click the &quot;Task list&quot; button from the text editor toolbar to add a task.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/thread_admin/tasklist1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="name-and-assign-the-task-to-a-person"><a class="header" href="#name-and-assign-the-task-to-a-person">Name and assign the task to a person</a></h2>
<p>From here you can name the task, assign someone with the standard @mention feature, and even set a due date with a reminder notification.
<img src="user_manual/threads/thread_admin/tasklist2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you have assigned task to someone, or a task is assigned to you, the task will appear on your Tasks page so you can easily keep track of the tasks you’re responsible for.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/thread_admin/task_list.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="set-a-reminder"><a class="header" href="#set-a-reminder">Set a reminder</a></h2>
<p>If you click &quot;Add due date&quot;, you'll be asked when the task is due, and when to send a reminder to person assigned to the task. The &quot;Task due&quot; notification is sent via email.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/thread_admin/taskreminderform.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="mark-it-as-done"><a class="header" href="#mark-it-as-done">Mark it as done</a></h2>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/thread_admin/taskdone.png" alt="" />
The primary action for a task is to mark it as “done” by clicking the checkbox at the beginning of the task. This can be done while you’re editing the text, or when you’re reading the text if you’re the assignee of the task, and also from the Tasks page.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="thread-templates"><a class="header" href="#thread-templates">Thread templates</a></h1>
<p>If you frequently use a particular thread, workflow or decision making process, you can now save this as a thread template.</p>
<p>Build and save your thread template with the content and polls appropriate to your process.</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="set-up-a-thread-template"><a class="header" href="#set-up-a-thread-template">Set up a thread template</a></h2>
<p>To set up your own template, start a thread in your group as usual.  </p>
<p>Go to the <strong>Settings</strong> tab and check the <strong>Template</strong> box.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_start.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Back on the <strong>Content</strong> tab, add a category tag(s), title and provide some sample text to help people using the template.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_start_2.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click <strong>Start thread</strong> and your new thread template is created.</p>
<p>The thread is clearly marked as a template.  Note the statement at the top of the thread page and the <strong>Template</strong> tag alongside the thread privacy tag.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_thread_outline.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>There is value to easily copy and share a thread name, tags and context that is frequently used.</p>
<p>However, the real benefit comes when you add the polls for a particular decision or workflow process, so they are readily available for people using the template.  Add the polls in the order of your process.</p>
<p>See this video as Michael walks through the creation of a thread template.</p>

<p>In the video example of the <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/decisions/index.html">Simple decision process</a>, the first poll is a Sense check:</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_sense_check.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Note that <strong>Voting open</strong> is unticked - this is a template thread, so not used for actual voting.</p>
<p><strong>Save poll</strong>. </p>
<p>As voting is not open, you can invite people to provide feedback on the poll if you wish.</p>
<p>Repeat by adding further polls as needed.</p>
<p>The thread template will then contain the content and polls typically used in your decision or workflow process.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_thread_ready.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="using-thread-templates"><a class="header" href="#using-thread-templates">Using thread templates</a></h2>
<p>When a thread template has been created in your group, anyone in your group starting a new thread will see a new screen, asking if they want to start the thread as either:</p>
<ul>
<li>Blank - thread starts as usual with no pre-filled content</li>
<li>Simple decision process - your new thread template</li>
<li>New template - to start a new template</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_popup.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>When a thread template is selected, a copy of the thread template content is created.</p>
<p>Edit thread title and context as usual.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/threads/templates/template_thread_copy.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>The polls created in the template are now ready to use, in the order they were created.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="intro-to-polls"><a class="header" href="#intro-to-polls">Intro to Polls</a></h1>
<p>Polls help you make decisions and progress discussion to an outcome.</p>
<ul>
<li>Involve the right people to make better decisions </li>
<li>Get engagement, test ideas, listen and sense, identify priorities, and clarify issues, even if the solution might not yet be apparent </li>
<li>Set a deadline, prompt people who haven’t participated, and state an outcome</li>
<li>Flexibly use decision making processes that work for your group</li>
</ul>
<p>There are many types of decision tools in Loomio and many ways to use them.</p>
<h2 id="proposal"><a class="header" href="#proposal">Proposal</a></h2>
<p>At the heart of Loomio is the proposal.</p>
<p>A proposal helps convert a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. </p>
<p>For example, someone suggests a course of action and invites people to respond by voting agree, abstain or disagree. </p>
<p>As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. If someone contributes some new information or a strong opinion you can change your vote, if you wish.</p>
<p>In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.</p>
<p>A proposal and associated discussion, creates a record of how the decision came about.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/intro_to_decisions/proposal_example.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="other-poll-types"><a class="header" href="#other-poll-types">Other poll types</a></h2>
<p>Loomio includes a range of poll types to support participation in decision making.  You can configure polls to suit a particular decision process or voting method. </p>
<p><strong>Sense check</strong>: To ask people for feedback, questions and concerns before moving to a decision.</p>
<p><strong>Simple poll</strong>: A simple poll to ask people which option or options they approve.</p>
<p><strong>Time poll</strong>: Find the best time to meet, or to schedule an event. Like Doodle without all the ads…</p>
<p><strong>Opt-in</strong>: Find volunteers or participants to help or join a working group.</p>
<p><strong>Score poll</strong>: Find the degree of support for each option.</p>
<p><strong>Dot vote</strong>: Find degree of support by asking people to allocate a budget of points to options. </p>
<p><strong>Ranked choice</strong>: Rank a list of options in order of preference — useful for elections.</p>
<p><strong>New poll type</strong>: Configure the poll type you need with custom terminology, options and settings.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/intro_to_decisions/poll_list.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="all-poll-types-have-a-similar-structure"><a class="header" href="#all-poll-types-have-a-similar-structure">All poll types have a similar structure</a></h2>
<p>As you start using polls, you will notice the poll setup, running and closing follow a similar pattern:</p>
<p><strong>Set up poll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Give the poll a title</li>
<li>Assign a category tag</li>
<li>Describe the poll question, and how you want people to vote</li>
<li>Configure poll options</li>
<li>Set a closing deadline </li>
<li>Invite people</li>
</ul>
<p>In the &quot;Settings&quot; tab you can also set:</p>
<ul>
<li>Hide results, until vote is cast or poll closes</li>
<li>Anonymous voting</li>
<li>Vote reason to required, optional or disabled</li>
<li>Reminder that poll is closing soon to nobody, author, undecided voters or all voters</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Running poll:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>People vote and add a reason (optional) </li>
<li>Results are updated live</li>
<li>People can change their vote if new info emerges</li>
<li>A reminder is sent to people who haven’t voted </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Poll closed:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>The proposal or poll closes, and everyone can see the results</li>
<li>The author sets an outcome, notifying everyone of what will happen next.</li>

<li><strong>Settings</strong> to configure how the poll runs.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/starting_proposals/proposal_new.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="content-tab-1"><a class="header" href="#content-tab-1">Content tab</a></h3>
<p><strong>Group:</strong> (Standalone poll only.) If you are starting a standalone poll, check that the correct group is selected for your poll.</p>
<p><strong>Title:</strong> Give your poll a short, relevant title.</p>
<p><strong>Details:</strong> Explain what you are asking people to do and include enough details so everyone knows what it means to 'agree' or 'disagree'.</p>
<p>Avoid combining a range of ideas in one proposal, because people might agree to some aspects but not others and be unsure how to respond. You can break complex decisions down into multiple proposals.</p>
<p>When making a proposal, state your expectations and describe the impact the proposal will have if adopted. If it's a formal or binding proposal it's often worth describing what a 'disagree' or 'block' means.</p>
<p>Use the formatting tools to support your poll.  For example, attach a document file with the paperclip icon, insert an image, link to a website or online document, or even embed a video.</p>
<p><strong>Options:</strong> Each poll type provides options for voting.</p>
<p>In a Proposal poll, the default options are Agree, Abstain and Disagree with corresponding ‘show of thumbs’ voting icons.</p>
<p>You can add, edit and remove options to suit the decision process you are running.</p>
<p>For example if you are using a Consent process;</p>
<ul>
<li>Type ‘Consent’ in the new option panel, and click the + button to add the option</li>
<li>Type ‘Objection’ in the new option panel</li>
<li>Remove unwanted voting options by clicking the trash can symbol beside each option.</li>

<h4 id="edit-voting-options"><a class="header" href="#edit-voting-options">Edit voting options</a></h4>
<p>There is a lot of flexibility to configure voting options to suit the way your organization makes decisions.</p>
<p>Use the pencil icon alongside the voting option to open the edit modal:</p>
<p><strong>Option name:</strong> A short name for the option.</p>
<p><strong>Icon:</strong> Select the icon for the option; thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideway or hand up.</p>
<p><strong>Meaning:</strong> A sentence that explains what choosing this options means.</p>
<p><strong>Reason prompt:</strong> A question to prompt voters to provide their reasoning or reconsider their position. </p>

<p><img src="user_manual/polls/starting_proposals/proposal_voting_open.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Voting open:</strong> When ticked, voting will open as soon as the poll starts.</p>
<p>Untick if you want voting to open at a later time. For example if you are setting up a poll in advance of a general assembly meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Closing date and time:</strong> Select the closing date and time for your poll. </p>
<p>Give sufficient time for people to vote. You could time the proposal so it closes before a meeting, or avoid closing over a weekend, so that people will receive a timely reminder. If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.</p>
<p><strong>Who can vote?</strong> Invite everyone in the group or only specific people.</p>
<p>You can later add or remove people from an ‘Invite people only’ poll.</p>
<h2 id="poll-settings"><a class="header" href="#poll-settings">Poll Settings</a></h2>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/starting_proposals/proposal_settings.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Hide results:</strong> If you want people to vote without knowing how others have voted, you can hide the results of the poll.  Useful if you do not want people to be affected by how other people have voted.</p>
<p>Setting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Off (default) - means voting results are visible.</li>
<li>Until vote is cast - means voting results are not visible until you vote, and are then revealed.</li>
<li>Until proposal is closed - means voting results are not visible until the proposal closes. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Anonymous voting:</strong> If enabled, this allows people to vote anonymously - the identify of voters will not be associated to their votes.  This is useful for elections and secret ballots.  However this cannot be undone.</p>
<p><strong>Vote reason:</strong> It can be helpful to understand why people voted the way they did. With this setting, you can prompt people to share their thoughts when they vote.</p>
<p>Setting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Required - people must write something in the reason field before their vote is submitted.</li>
<li>Optional (default) - reason is optional.</li>
<li>Disabled - the reason text box is not available.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Limit reason to maximum 500 characters:</strong> Keeping vote reasons short makes them easier to understand. A collection of concise reasons is a great resource for making a decision.  So this setting is ticked by default.</p>
<p>However you can untick this setting to allow for longer reasons.</p>
<p><strong>Reminder:</strong> Send a 'Closing soon' notification 24 hours before the poll closes. This can be an opportunity for people to see how others have voted and reconsider their own vote, or just a way to increase participation in the poll.</p>
<p>Setting options:</p>
<ul>
<li>Nobody</li>
<li>Author</li>
<li>Undecided voters (default)</li>
<li>All voters</li>

<h2 id="sense-check"><a class="header" href="#sense-check">Sense check</a></h2>
<p><em>Ask for feedback, questions and concerns</em></p>
<p>Collaborative decisions include one or more rounds of feedback before a decision is made.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/sense_check.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Sense check</strong> poll is a simple way to get feedback on a decision before things get finalized - clarify and improve an idea before moving to a proposal. </p>
<p>Sense check lets people know a proposal is forming and encourages them to engage. It is an opportunity to listen to people, sense how they feel and respond appropriately - opening the potential to incorporate their contributions to make a better proposal - that’s more likely to pass.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/sense_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Use Sense check when you want to survey opinions, rather than advocate for a particular position. It is a great way to surface concerns before moving to a formal agreement.  You can find out if people are happy with where this is going, if they have questions or need more time, or if they are concerned and want something to change.</p>
<p>You can use one or more rounds of ‘Sense check’ to help you co-create a better, more cohesive decision with less stress and anxiety.</p>

<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/proposal_label.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>A Proposal is used to present a decision to be made. For example an agreement, document or policy for approval, resolution or appointment.</p>
<p>Proposal is also used in Advice, Consent and other collaborative decision making processes.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/proposal_options_new.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>

<p>Save time arranging a date for your meeting or event. </p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/timepoll_label.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Time poll makes it easy to see everyone's availability and find the best time.</p>
<p>Give your Time poll a title and details. Enter a list of date and time options in your time zone.</p>
<p>When setting timeslots, consider people in different time zones. Participants will see times localized in their time zone.</p>
<p>Set a meeting duration.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/timepoll_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="voting-1"><a class="header" href="#voting-1">Voting</a></h3>
<p>People mark the timeslots they are available with the green 'thumbs up' icon or leave the red 'thumbs down' in place when unavailable.  They can also use the 'thumbs sideways' icon to say they are available 'if need be'. </p>
<p>Participants can leave a reason comment to help the organizer find a suitable time.</p>
<p>If the times don't work, participants can suggest alternatives using the message field. You can then update the poll with new times.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/timepoll_vote.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>The results update as voting proceeds in a table showing who is available when, so everyone can see which timeslots are popular.</p>
<h3 id="outcome-2"><a class="header" href="#outcome-2">Outcome</a></h3>

<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/opt_in_label.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>‘Opt-in’ has two voting options: Accept or Decline. </p>
<p>Set how many people you are looking for, say 3 people to join your working group.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/opt_in_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Use Opt-in to seek engagement and encourage participation.  For example think of Opt-in as the online way to ask a room of people <em>&quot;Raise you hand if ...&quot;</em></p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/opt_in_results.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Like other Loomio polls, Opt-in asks you to set a closing time and will automatically notify people 24 hours before close - encouraging people to participate in a timely way so you can get on with the work. </p>
<h2 id="score-poll"><a class="header" href="#score-poll">Score Poll</a></h2>
<p><em>Measure the degree of support for each option</em></p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/score_label.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Use Score poll when you want to survey people for their desire, preference or interest in each option. </p>
<p>'Anonymous voting' and 'Shuffle options' settings are common for Score poll to reduce any voting bias.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/score_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Participants are asked to evaluate each option and assign a score by moving a slider along a scale.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/score_voting.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Results are displayed graphically along with a table for each option showing total points, mean points and the number of voters.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/score_results.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>

<p><em>Allocate a budget of points to reveal priorities</em></p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/dot_vote_label.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>This poll type is useful for groups trying to allocate a limited resource to a number of options.  It goes beyond a simple poll by helping participants appreciate there is a constraint when selecting options.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/dot_vote_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Participants are each given a set number of dots.  You decide how many.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/dot_vote_voting.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>They place dots next to options presented that they like.  Participants can place all their dots on a single option or spread over multiple options.</p>
<p>As participants allocate dots, they may exceed the dot budget limit and so are encouraged to consider how they spend their dots carefully.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/dot_vote_results.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Options with the most dots “win”.  The results table provides additional data to help you analyse results.</p>

<p>Ranked choice is particularly useful when you have a large number of options or holding an election. </p>
<p>This poll type offers a series of options for people to vote in their preferred order. </p>
<p>'Anonymous voting' and 'Shuffle options' settings are common for Ranked choice to reduce any voting bias.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/ranked_choice_options.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can choose the number of votes people can give and rank. </p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/ranked_choice_voting.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Voters drag and drop options in order of preference (#1 being your most preferred option). </p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/proposal_types/ranked_choice_results.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Take time to consider the results then share an outcome so people know what will happen next.</em></p>
<p>When your poll closes, you’ll be prompted to set a poll outcome.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/outcomes/outcome_prompt.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>In Loomio, the outcome or conclusion of a poll is up to you to define on behalf of the group - it's not assumed that majority wins.</p>
<p>A formal decision may be governed by constitution or by prior agreement within your organization.</p>
<p>Sometimes it makes sense to go with the majority, but sometimes even one dissenting voice means it's a no.  For example, the Consent decision process continues until there are no objections.</p>
<p>Whatever the results, there is always something to learn from the proposal. </p>
<p>Your outcome statement is an opportunity to state the results and what has been learnt.  Use outcome to let everyone know what will happen next.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/outcomes/outcome_statement.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Review the poll intentions and results and write your outcome.</p>
<p>You can notify people - they will receive an email from Loomio containing the poll results and your outcome statement.</p>
<p>You can also choose to set a <strong>Review date</strong> - a future date when you would like to review this poll or decision.  For example to review a strategy at the same time next year.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/outcomes/outcome_published.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Example outcomes</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>This proposal did not reach consensus because several people were concerned about budget impacts. George and Jimena will do some financial modelling and raise a new proposal next week.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I've taken on board everyone's input. As the project manager, this is my call to make and I've decided we are going to extend the timeline by 10 days.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Setting outcomes makes your decision archive easy to search, because you have a succinct statement for each proposal.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="making-collaborative-decisions"><a class="header" href="#making-collaborative-decisions">Making Collaborative Decisions</a></h1>
<p>Making decisions collaboratively involves people, shares power and responsibility, reduces risk and increases the prospect that it will be a good decision.</p>
<p>Practices for making good collaborative decisions have evolved and there are now a number of decision-making processes you can employ.  Many collaborative organizations use one or more processes, depending on the type of decision, governing policy and culture.  Consensus, advice and consent processes are common.</p>
<p>Making decisions with other people often happens when everyone involved is present in one room. The topic and need for decision is introduced, clarifying questions asked, and a discussion takes place to help everyone understand the context for the decision.  The decision to be made is proposed and people are invited to vote. </p>
<p>Straight-forward decisions are often resolved quickly, although more complex or challenging decisions may require further deliberation.  A facilitator can help uncover tensions and disagreement. There is also the potential for new information to be introduced that may change people's minds.</p>
<p>When voting is complete and the decision is made, the decision proposer or facilitator announces the outcome of the decision and what will happen next.</p>
<p>However for many organizations today, getting everyone together in one room at the right time is nigh on impossible.  People work remotely and communicate at different times.  Email and online chat tools are not equipped to support collaborative decision making.</p>
<h2 id="collaborative-decision-making-in-loomio"><a class="header" href="#collaborative-decision-making-in-loomio">Collaborative decision making in Loomio</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is designed for collaborative decision making, enabling you to replicate in-person decision making practices online -  inclusive, transparent, participative and facilitated.</p>
<p>This guide will help you get started with Loomio to make online collaborative decisions in your organization.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/decisions/index.html">Simple decision process</a></strong> - A simple process to introduce and discuss the decision to be made, listen and sense how people think about it, propose and decide.

<p><strong><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/advice_process/index.html">Advice process</a></strong> - Seek the feedback and advice to help you make a better decision. Anyone can make a decision as long as they listen to input from people impacted or with relevant expertise.</p>
<p><strong><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consent_process/index.html">Consent process</a></strong> - Seek consent to make a decision. A decision can be made as long as no team member has a valid objection.</p>
<h2 id="loomio-proposal"><a class="header" href="#loomio-proposal">Loomio Proposal</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is built around the proposal.</p>
<p>A proposal helps convert a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. For example someone suggests a course of action and invites people to respond by voting agree, abstain or disagree. Proposal voting options are available for common decision-making processes and you can create voting options to suit your organization.</p>
<p>As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if the proposal is still open, you can change your response.</p>
<p>In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.</p>
<p>A proposal and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>

<p>Ever since Loomio was founded, we have experimented, worked on and practiced what it means to make collaborative decisions.</p>
<p>Some organizations arrive at Loomio having already developed a deep culture and practice of collaborative decision making.  Such organizations have often written handbooks and codified their practices, and want to see how their decision making processes can be realized within Loomio.  If this sounds like you, then skip on to see how to apply your decision making processes in Loomio with templates.</p>
<p>However most organizations are still on the journey and looking for some helpful first steps towards making better decisions together.  If the burning question in your organization is <strong>how do we make decisions together?</strong>, then this guide is for you.</p>
<p><em><strong>Here are three steps to help you co-create a better, more cohesive decision with less stress and anxiety.</strong></em></p>
<h2 id="simple-decision-making---in-3-steps"><a class="header" href="#simple-decision-making---in-3-steps">Simple decision making - in 3 steps</a></h2>
<p>Good collaborative decisions rarely happen by themselves.  They almost always benefit from someone facilitating the discussion through to decision.  So when you launch a discussion thread, you take on a facilitation role (unless someone else is facilitating).</p>
<p>Follow these 3 steps as you facilitate your group to make a good decision.</p>
<h3 id="step-1---introduce-and-discuss"><a class="header" href="#step-1---introduce-and-discuss">Step 1 - Introduce and discuss</a></h3>
<p>Start a Loomio <strong>thread</strong> to introduce the topic, open discussion and invite people. Include all the context-setting information your group needs to meaningfully participate, along with relevant background so everyone understands the purpose.</p>
<p>Be clear about your objective - what is the decision to be made or intended outcome of the discussion? </p>
<p>As discussion progresses, create space for diverse input - sometimes the best ideas and input come from outside the box.  Work together to explore and test ideas, encouraging a healthy and open discussion.</p>
<p>Notice when the same voices are dominating and invite some of the quieter people to contribute by @mentioning them and asking them what they think. </p>
<p>You can make a complex discussion easier to engage with by updating the thread context section with a summary of the key points.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/decisions/decision_step1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="step-2---sense-check"><a class="header" href="#step-2---sense-check">Step 2 - Sense check</a></h3>
<p>As your group begins to converge on path forwards, use a <strong>Sense check</strong> poll to survey opinions and test how the group feels.</p>
<p>A ‘Sense check’ lets people know a proposal is forming and encourages them to engage.
It can also be used to clarify an issue, even if the solution might not be apparent yet.</p>
<p>Sense check is a great way to surface concerns before moving to a formal agreement.  You can find out if people are happy with where this is going, if they have questions or need more time, or if they are concerned.</p>
<p>Use feedback to improve and refine the proposal. If there’s still some work to do, you may need to go back to Step 1 and then run another Sense check round. </p>
<p>Good engagement will help you assess when you are ready to proceed to a proposal.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/decisions/decision_step2.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="step-3---proposal"><a class="header" href="#step-3---proposal">Step 3 - Proposal</a></h3>
<p>Now when you raise a formal <strong>Proposal</strong>, you do so with confidence that it will pass. </p>
<p>There may have been a lot of discussion and variations suggested, so be specific about the decision being made, so that everyone knows what the voting options mean.</p>
<p>Set proposal deadlines consciously, so group members have time to consider and engage.  You can always extend the closing date if need be.</p>
<p>This step is important to formalize agreement with people’s vote and to state an outcome - what just happened and what will happen next.</p>
<p>Proposal results are logged, along with a record of the discussion leading to the decision.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/decisions/decision_step3.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="outcome-4"><a class="header" href="#outcome-4">Outcome</a></h3>
<p>When a Loomio poll closes, you will be prompted to set an <strong>outcome</strong> to let everyone know what happened and what is going to happen next.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/polls/decisions/decision_step4_outcome.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="proposals-can-help-in-many-situations"><a class="header" href="#proposals-can-help-in-many-situations">Proposals can help in many situations</a></h2>
<p>Don't hesitate to start a proposal just because you're not sure everyone will agree - proposals are not only for when you have consensus, they're designed to surface issues that need resolving and are useful for clarifying disagreements. </p>

<p><em>A simple guide to consultative decision making on &amp; off Loomio</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/check.png" alt="on the left is a thermometer with Goal and a lightning bolt at the top; to the right, several people raise their hands or chew on pencils, one with a notebook in hand. Above their heads two have green check marks, while one has a yellow minus sign above their head and a pensive look." /></p>
<p>Today I want to show you how to make decisions that receive  more engagement (and, thus, better performance), build team confidence and alignment, and – when done well – increase interpersonal trust and motivation, all while maintaining <strong>efficiency</strong>. Trusting those closest to the problem to own the decision and be responsible for their own work – while simultaneously taking advantage of input and expertise within the organization – is possible, and can be done without sacrificing the ability to respond and adapt quickly.</p>
<p>This way of decision making improves accountability, will lead to more motivation and better work from everyone in your group and – ultimately – produce the clear outcomes your group needs.<img src="guides/advice_process/advice_consent_decision_types.png" align="right" alt="An equilateral triangle with points reading, from top to bottom, “Advice, Top-down (autocratic), Group ([Consent](../consent_process), consensus)”"/> While a lot of processes also address some of these obstacles (for example, <a href="guides/advice_process/../consent_process">Consent</a>) many teams prefer to use a technique like <em>“advice process”</em> often modeled after the one popularized by <em>Reinventing Organizations.</em></p>
<h2 id="how-it-works-anywhere"><a class="header" href="#how-it-works-anywhere"><strong>How it works</strong> anywhere</a></h2>
<p>In one sentence, using Advice Process means</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/advice_process_one_liner.png" alt="Anybody can make a decision if they have all the advice they need to make a good decision for the business; this includes *asking those impacted or with expertise.*¹" /></p>
<p>For example: Sam’s got a website for a newly developed product, and wants the marketing team to start promoting it.</p>
<p>Here’s how the Advice Process went for Sam:</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process1.png" alt="Sam’s cartoon face with speech bubble, “The website I made is ready to be promoted (?)”" /></p>
<p>Sam asks for feedback from the marketing director and the products director.</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process2.png" alt="Sam’s cartoon face with two ↔ between them and two of their colleagues" /></p>
<p>The marketing director advises that it’s still the holidays across the pond.</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process3.png" alt="One of the colleagues and Sam, where the colleague’s speech bubble reads, “It’s still some folks’ holidays”" /></p>
<p>Sam is a quick problem solver.</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process4.png" alt="One of the colleagues and Sam, where Sam’s speech bubble reads, “Could Marketing promote it next week?”" /></p>
<p>Confident that there was sufficient feedback and that the marketing director’s tension was resolved – amending the intention (push it <em>next week,</em> not <em>immediately</em>), Sam publishes the website and schedules it for promotion, alerting the marketing team of their responsibility.</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process5.png" alt="Sam next to a computer depicting a webpage with a green check emoji overlapping it." /></p>
<p>Sam documents the decision…</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process6.png" alt="Sam with a keyboard and an arrow connecting keyboard → three other people " /></p>
<p>…putting it somewhere the team could see it.</p>
<p><img src="guides/advice_process/sam_uses_advice_process7.png" alt="A computer-like text box, where the keyboard had been, reads, “Marketing to promote the site starting Monday; thanks!” The text, “the site” is hyperlinked. The other three people can see the text box." /></p>
<p>Here’s the steps that Sam took:</p>
<ol>
<li>She <strong>stated an intention</strong></li>
<li>She <strong>collected feedback</strong></li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li>She <strong>responded to concerns</strong> (and tensions)</li>
</ul>
<ol start="3">
<li>She <strong>made the decision</strong></li>
<li>and communicated and <strong>recorded it</strong> adequately.</li>
</ol>
<p>You’ll notice that Sam has made a decision that calls for others to execute the work. To get all the benefits, decisions made by advice process need to be considered the decision <em>of the team</em> or organization. You don’t have to make advice process available for every kind of decision, but encourage everyone to stand behind those you do. That said, it’s important to note that <strong>decision makers are accountable for their decisions,</strong> even if there are other people responsible for completing any tasks that are called for. In most cases, aligning power with accountability will get you better results.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Tip:</b> Ideally (not depicted above) Sam has explained why she made the choice, for the record and for team learning. </i></p>

<p><strong>Feedback is hard.</strong> I can think of plenty of times when I just wanted to keep moving forward on a project when I knew it would be better to invite a colleague into conversation. <em>What if addressing their comments slows down my progress? What if I need to start over? Do their comments mean my work isn’t valuable?</em> All of these hypothetical worries tend to keep us from reaching out for feedback about something, especially something that didn’t go well. EFeedback is critical to improving outcomes, and it doesn’t have to be hard; there are frameworks that can make it easier (eg, <strong>ASK:</strong> feedback is best when it’s <strong>A</strong>ctionable, <strong>S</strong>pecific, and <strong>K</strong>ind).</p>
<p><strong>Giving feedback is a responsibility:</strong> If someone from your organization asks you for feedback and you don’t provide needed input, you also have accountability for the outcome. So, if you have something valuable to add, there's an expectation that you say it.</p>
<p><strong>Receiving feedback can be hard,</strong> but it’s easier if your team has worked on the capacity to <strong>suspend judgement</strong>: setting aside personal opinions to examine suggestions or critiques from others while assuming positive intent – i.e., that they’re trying to improve the effort.</p>
<p style="margin-left:1em;margin-right:1em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><span style="font-size:130%">Efficiency and effectiveness are directly related to the capacity for open, honest, and direct communication.</span></p>
<p><strong>Accountability can get left out.</strong> Decision makers may not become aware of any poor outcomes, losing the opportunity to learn or to fix significant issues; <em>the buck has to stop somewhere.</em> This makes feedback, and systems for regular reflection, even more critical.</p>
<p><strong>Communication is hard,</strong> but advice process can actually be a step towards improving communications for your team. If your group is considering adopting it, that means you’re somewhere on your journey towards being a more collaborative organization. It can be of great value to pick up advice process early on and to practice it with specific kinds of decisions. Your organization may decide to try it out in one team (or just for picking meeting dates, etc.) as you get started.</p>
<h3 id="your-first-experiment-checklist"><a class="header" href="#your-first-experiment-checklist">Your first experiment (checklist)</a></h3>
<p>For your first advice process experiment, you might want to check that the people who need to be involved or aware of it can answer the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>How will we use advice process, and when? Limitations?</li>
<li>What good could come from adopting this technique?</li>
<li>How does this affect my work?</li>
<li>When will decisions be reviewed?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Transparency</strong> is important; think about whether those who can make the decisions will be able to have the information they need. Transparency also supports another critical element, trust.</p>
<p><strong>Trust</strong> will elevate your advice process, and <em>all</em> your decision making, to the next level. The benefits compound when that trust is built on:</p>
<ul>
<li>Open and honest communication (again!) and the skills that support it</li>
<li><strong>A culture that is comfortable with healthy conflict.</strong> ² (<a href="https://loomio.coop/conflict_resolution.html">practical tips</a>)</li>

<h3 id="tips-and-tricks"><a class="header" href="#tips-and-tricks">Tips and tricks</a></h3>
<p><strong>Name your biases,</strong> ⁴ everyone has them. Lack of awareness around biases can lead you and your team to miss important information. Naming your biases increases your awareness and helps your advisors give you better advice.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Example, Solution bias:</b> If you are biased towards a particular solution to the problem/opportunity you’re trying to solve, let your advisors know. If you are running an advice process about different software vendors and you think one vendor is the best fit, say it and explain why. This will help advisors ask better questions and give better advice.</i></p>
<p><strong>Who to invite feedback from</strong> is not always clear, and there may be a limit to how many people you have time to engage. One simple tool you can consider is the acronym from Janoff &amp; Weisbord's Future Search, “Invite those who <strong>ARE IN</strong>”. Invite those who have <strong>A</strong>uthority, <strong>R</strong>esources, <strong>E</strong>xpertise, <strong>I</strong>nformation, or have a <strong>N</strong>eed in regards to the consultation or outcome – if someone is impacted, they should be involved.</p>

<p>Advice process, as a tool, makes <strong>good business sense</strong>, and it can deliver even more than that. How would it feel if you knew you had full support of your team the next time you needed to make an important decision? Advice process – and, moreover, a <em>culture of advice process</em> – may be used to transform an organization’s philosophy or overall governance and operations. Some teams have significantly grown their capacity by adopting it more deeply.</p>

<p>You can quickly make better decisions by using advice process. All it takes is a proposal, asking for feedback, making an informed decision, and sharing the outcome. You’re already on your way to a more engaged team achieving faster, higher quality decisions.</p>

<p><em>A simple 'how to' for groups to use Integrative Consent on &amp; off Loomio</em></p>
<p><em>By Loomio and Round Sky Solutions—creators of the Integrative Consent process.</em></p>
<p>Our world grows more complex, with higher stakes and feelings of scarcity increasing by the day. Time is of the essence, the relevance of our actions more vital, and our ability to work together to transform Goliath challenges more pressing than ever.</p>
<p>Yet our ability to collectively make effective and efficient decisions – and then collaboratively and consistently enact them – remains elusive, sometimes there and sometimes not. If we can better collaborate, we can improve participation and engagement <em>and</em> gain momentum in bringing about a more beautiful world.</p>
<p><img src="guides/consent_process/better_collaboration.png" alt="A workshop space with many hands and materials" /></p>
<p>Decision making is a key part of effective collaboration, both individual and collective, including who makes which decisions, by which methods, and when. In this article, we begin a series of simple step-by-step guides for better collaboration and collective decision making in any group, and especially with groups working across space and time.</p>
<p>Given that we are currently emerging out of a long history of top down leadership as the dominant way of leading, collective decision making faces some challenges:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lack of clear process can leave people confused and unable to meaningfully participate, e.g., <em>‘what are we deciding?’</em> or <em>‘how will this go?’</em>  and <em>'how does my voice matter?'</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Without an explicit process, you'll still use one – just an unintentional one, often falling back to norms like top down or majority rules.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Frustration can occur if it’s unclear whether we’re done deciding.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Groups can try to make decisions around EVERYTHING instead of what really needs collective time and energy.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>On the other hand, lack of process can lead to harmful or ineffective actions by neglecting to include/involve those impacted by the decision, which can ultimately lead to <em>poor implementation</em> and <em>disengagement</em></p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Decisions can fail to be made or take way too long.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Loud, dominating personalities or people with more time than others can overpower some voices.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>No record of the decisions means we are creating the potential for conflict which we will then have to resolve… again.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rewriting-the-rules"><a class="header" href="#rewriting-the-rules">Rewriting the rules</a></h2>
<p>One of the best ways we’ve found to overcome these obstacles is to make decisions using <strong>consent-based decision making</strong>, or just <strong>consent</strong>. There are, of course, many different kinds of collective decision-making processes, (eg, <a href="guides/consent_process/../advice_process">advice process</a>,) including different versions of consent, but we’ve found <strong>Integrative Consent</strong> – a model developed by Round Sky Solutions – to be a simple and effective starting place for a team wanting to learn a consent process. We hope you’ll use this as a template, iterate variations on it that fit your unique team, and pass what you learn back to us!</p>
<p><img src="guides/consent_process/decision_making_types.png" alt="Decision-making types: Autocratic (and Delegation) | Advice (or Consultative) | Consent (or Consensus)" /></p>
<h2 id="face-to-face-or-online"><a class="header" href="#face-to-face-or-online">Face to face or Online?</a></h2>
<p>The steps you’ll learn in Integrative Consent are useful whether in person or online. And we believe all teams have something to gain by moving some decisions online. In particular, online, asynchronous decision making can:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Alleviate the time pressure in meetings, leaving more time in meetings for important conversations.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Encourage more thoughtful and considerate decisions as participants have time to ‘sleep on it.’</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Enable teams to have a clear and easily accessible record.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Make the process easier to learn by making the process visible and accessible to varied learning styles.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consent-based-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#consent-based-decision-making">Consent-based decision making</a></h2>
<p>Integrative Consent is an evolution upon Sociocracy’s (and Holacracy’s) decision making processes which evolved out of consensus. All of these bring great value to the world, but each have some limitations which Integrative Consent transcends. The intent with Integrative Consent is to match a clear process with what seems to be working well when humans are engaged in collective decision making so that we can reliably replicate efficient and effective collaborative decision making anywhere and anytime we choose.</p>
<p><img src="guides/consent_process/integrative_consent_steps.png" alt="Integrative Consent steps: 1.  Proposal 2.  Questions and Comments 3.  Amendment 4.  Integration (Objections → Validate → Integrate …repeat until no objections remain)" /></p>
<h1 id="integrative-consent"><a class="header" href="#integrative-consent">Integrative Consent</a></h1>
<h2 id="step-1-proposal"><a class="header" href="#step-1-proposal">STEP 1: Proposal</a></h2>
<p>First is the <strong>proposal</strong>. This step is best done in writing so that there is no ambiguity and it’s easier to keep the details of the proposed idea in mind. There are two ways this happens:</p>
<p><strong>1.</strong>  A proposal surfacing within an <strong>open discussion</strong><a href="guides/consent_process/index.html#glossary"> ¹</a></p>
<p>It's often best if the person who raised it with the group continues as the <strong>proposer</strong><a href="guides/consent_process/index.html#glossary"> ²</a>, crafting a proposal out of everyone's input.</p>
<p><strong>2.</strong>  The proposer has an idea – and puts it in writing to start the process.</p>
<p>It’s also a good idea to set someone up as a <strong>facilitator</strong><a href="guides/consent_process/index.html#glossary"> ³</a> who can help the proposer do their job efficiently, checking in with them to see if they have enough information to craft and refine their proposal. Either way, the proposer gets something in writing as the initial proposal for step one.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Facilitators:</b> it is important to remember that it is not your choice which option to take in step one; that choice belongs to the proposer.</i></p>
<h2 id="step-2-questions-and-comments"><a class="header" href="#step-2-questions-and-comments">STEP 2: Questions and Comments</a></h2>
<p>This <strong>round</strong><a href="guides/consent_process/index.html#glossary"> ⁴</a> can include clarifying questions, sharing points of information, making any desired responses, including better ideas for the proposal on the table. If there are questions, it is the proposer who gets to answer them or delegate them to whoever they would like to answer that question. During this step it’s very important for the proposer to be listening carefully and paying close attention to what’s being shared for anything that they would like to change about their proposal, which is the third step. If you are facilitating this process synchronously, it’s important to keep this as a <em>round</em><a href="guides/consent_process/index.html#glossary"> ³</a> and not open discussion.</p>
<h2 id="step-3-amendment"><a class="header" href="#step-3-amendment">STEP 3: Amendment</a></h2>
<p>Step three, <em>amend</em>, is where the proposer makes changes at their discretion to their proposal based on the input they received in step two. The proposer doesn’t have to amend anything or respond to everything shared in step two. Their job is to change what they feel would be best <strong>on behalf of the whole team</strong>, not just their, or anyone else’s, personal preferences. Once we have an amended proposal, then we move into step four, integrate.</p>
<h2 id="step-4-integration-objections"><a class="header" href="#step-4-integration-objections">STEP 4: Integration (objections)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Integration</strong> is where things get interesting. During this phase, all team members are invited to present any <strong>objections</strong> they have, with objections being defined as what “<strong>might cause harm to the team or organization</strong>”. Now, how do we know if it might cause harm? This question can sometimes open a can of worms if there is not a clear agreement about what is a valid objection. At the very least, we recommend that an objection needs to have a reasoned case that can be made explicit. If the ‘why’ of the objection is unclear, it may be impossible to integrate and waste a lot of time. Beyond that, there are a number of other basic questions your group could ask of each objection to ensure that they will not just cause the team to go round and round in circles. We call these validation criteria. Your group will likely want to agree on the criteria that work best for you, but we think you might find these basic ones useful to get started:</p>
<p><img src="guides/consent_process/valid_objections_guide.png" alt="Objections  are that which might cause harm to the team or organization: ‘Minimum viable criteria’ for useful objections: explicit  -  I can make a reasoned case | impersonal  -  It’s not just a personal preference | evidenced  -  Not predictive; based in experience | not ‘safe to fail’  -  It’s not that I have a ‘better idea’" /></p>
<p>So, a few examples of why we wouldn’t want to consider every reasoned objection valid. Maybe my objection is a personal reason why I don’t like the particular proposal. Perhaps we’re deciding on our brand colors and maybe I personally don’t like red, but market research shows that our customers actually love red. My objection that I don’t like red doesn’t constitute harm to the whole, it’s a reflection of my personal wishes.</p>
<p>Another example might be that I’ve just had a better idea. Better ideas in general are great, and we definitely want to encourage them during questions and comments, but not during integrate. Why? Because we’ll be starting a better idea war and could spend the rest of the year competing against each other for the best idea, and depending on how desperate our egos are we could easily spend the team’s valuable resources doing just that. At this stage in the process, it’s time to get to ‘good enough for now’, what’s ‘safe to try’, then garner data from real life and evolve the agreements later.</p>
<p>And the third way in which objections are not valid is that they are based on predictive concerns for which we have no current data. Are we afraid our customers hate red or do we have actual market research? Predictive concerns can frankly just be wrong, and we can end up spending lots of team resources trying to integrate predictive concerns, especially if we have no relevant experience that supports our concerns.</p>
<h3 id="integration-objections-to-completion"><a class="header" href="#integration-objections-to-completion">Integration (objections to completion)</a></h3>
<p>Once all objections have been surfaced then we can complete integration. This includes understanding the concerns and checking that each objection meets the validation criteria. Your facilitator should pick one objection at a time and integrate it via open discussion to create an amended version of the proposal. It’s important that the proposal in its changed form still resolves the proposer’s tension. In other words, it would be pointless to change the proposal so that it no longer addresses the need that put it on the table in the first place, though how that need gets met may be different than the way the proposer initially conceived. This process is repeated for all valid objections, remembering that new objections may be raised as we change the proposal. When there are no further objections, the proposal has passed.</p>

<p>As we mentioned, there’s a number of benefits from doing some of your consent processes online. Here's how (on Loomio):</p>

<h2 id="key-pitfalls"><a class="header" href="#key-pitfalls">Key Pitfalls</a></h2>
<p>There are a few key pitfalls to avoid as you learn to use this process.</p>
<p>PITFALL 1: Getting sidetracked because the team or facilitator is lost in the process, for example, not knowing who is in charge of the proposal at which step in the process.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Example:</b> A meeting where you’ve gone in circles for far too long, because people have a million questions and comments and no one feels bold enough to end that particular step of the process.</i></p>
<p>PITFALL 2: Trying to get the best, most perfect idea that everyone loves… great goal, but it is not often attainable (or real) and is not necessary for effective collaboration!</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Example:</b> The proposer has heard many different possible changes to their initial proposal and wants to please everyone, so has taken a lot of group time to wordsmith their proposal during amend to try to get it perfect. Then in objections someone raises a concern regarding a specific term which isn’t actually something that causes harm, just a personal preference, but the facilitator then tries to integrate it and finds someone else raises an objection about the new term, and so on until the team has run out of time to act.</i></p>
<p>PITFALL 3: Getting stuck with validating and integrating objections.</p>
<p style="margin-left:2em;margin-right:2em;margin-top:2em;margin-bottom:2em"><i><b>Example:</b> Someone strongly and emotionally objects to a proposal but can’t say much more than they really don’t like the proposal and won’t stand behind it.</i></p>

<h2 id="safe-to-try"><a class="header" href="#safe-to-try">Safe to try</a></h2>
<p>The most important thing to remember when you are using Integrative Consent is that you should be aiming for decisions that are <em>safe to try</em>. It is unlikely that your team will make the perfect decision every time but by opening the door for your entire team to weigh in you will maximize your brainpower and arrive at a workable solution faster than you could have alone.</p>

<p><strong>Advice Process:</strong> A faster, consultative style of decision-making that can still grow buy-in, trust, and collective intelligence. <a href="guides/consent_process/../advice_process">Learn how, here</a>.</p>
<p><strong>Open Discussion:</strong> a discussion style where all members of the team contribute as they have something to offer in a popcorn style.</p>
<p><strong>Proposer:</strong> the individual who raises an item for consideration which requires a decision.</p>
<p><strong>Facilitator:</strong> someone who can help the proposer do their job efficiently. For example, in step 1, they might check in with them to see if they have enough information to craft and refine their proposal.</p>
<p><strong>Round:</strong> a discussion style where one person shares at a time as requested by the facilitator.</p>
<p><strong>Objection:</strong> what might cause harm to the team or organization.</p>
<p><strong>Consent-based decision making</strong>, or consent process, is a broad class of group decision-making processes that include Consensus (at its best) and other forms of proposal-based decision making where those participating are empowered to block the proposal if they can articulate a reason the proposal might cause harm. There are a variety of methods or flavors, such as Integrative Consent (described in this article) and also Generative Decision Making which draws more attention to whether the proposal is &quot;ripe&quot; among other nuanced distinctions.</p>

<h2 id="emails"><a class="header" href="#emails">Emails</a></h2>
<p>Loomio sends emails to keep you updated on the activity in your groups. The default settings assume that you don't have a habit of using Loomio regularly so are designed to ensure you can stay up to date by checking your emails.</p>
<p>Emails we send out include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A daily summary called <strong>Yesterday on Loomio</strong>. This includes activity from all your groups and threads, but only content which you have not read yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention</strong> and <strong>Reply</strong> notifications. If someone replies to a comment you wrote, or they write a comment and mention you in it, you'll get an email with what they wrote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invitations to threads and notification of polls or proposals. If someone wants to notify the group about a new decision or discussion thread, they can select everyone or just some people in the group to notify. Also be aware of <strong>poll closing soon</strong> and <strong>outcome</strong> notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thread updates. If <strong>subscribe on participation</strong> is checked, then after you comment or vote within a thread, you'll be emailed any further activity.</p>
</li>

<p>These can all be accessed from the sidebar, and each display a different list of threads, or more specifically, <strong>Thread previews</strong>; learn more about the previews and high-level actions you can use to manage these <a href="user_manual/users/navigation/index.html#understanding-thread-previews">below</a>, as it's important to first understand the different pages that help with navigation:</p>
<h2 id="recent-threads"><a class="header" href="#recent-threads">Recent threads</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Recent threads</strong> page gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. You can access this page via the sidebar. If you are a member of multiple groups, the Recent threads page will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio <em>unless you are only a member of a single group.</em></p>
<p>The Recent Threads page displays content from your groups in an ordered list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity (Today, Yesterday, This week, This month, Older than a month).</p>
<p>If a thread or proposal title is highlighted with a yellow line along its left border, then new activity has taken place since you last visited and this thread is considered <strong>unread</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="unread-threads"><a class="header" href="#unread-threads">Unread threads</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Unread threads</strong> page shows all threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can access this page via the sidebar. You can clear unread items without reading them by hovering over the thread preview and clicking <strong>mark as read</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="group-pages"><a class="header" href="#group-pages">Group pages</a></h2>
<p>Because Loomio is a place for your group, we have designed the <strong>Group page</strong> to be the hub and dashboard for your group.</p>
<p>Group pages are where you start threads, where most of the action happens.</p>
<p><img src="user_manual/users/navigation/new_thread.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>By default, your group page lists all of the open threads in your group. You can use the thread filter on the left to show…</p>
<ul>
<li>threads that are archived or <a href="user_manual/users/navigation/../../threads/thread_admin/#close-thread">closed</a></li>
<li>only the unread threads</li>
<li>all of the threads, open or closed.</li>

<p>You can use a <a href="https://www.loomio.com/try">demo</a> to see Loomio in action, this can help provide contexts for strings when you see them via Transifex.</p>
<p>If your language distinguishes between personal and impersonal, use the more personal!</p>
<p>Make sure that you understand the different type of polls and activities that groups can do and that these are translated in way that is logical in your language.</p>

<h2 id="what-does-delete-account-mean"><a class="header" href="#what-does-delete-account-mean">What does delete account mean?</a></h2>
<p>When you delete your account:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user account including your name, email address and other personally identifying data will be deleted from our systems. You will not be able to sign in to Loomio with this account.</li>
<li>Comments, proposal and discussions you have made will remain but your name will be removed from them. We do this because we have an obligation to groups to keep threads and proposals coherent.</li>
<li>You will no longer be listed as a member of any groups.</li>
<li>You will no longer receive notification emails.</li>
</ul>
<p>It is important to understand that copies of the data you have generated on Loomio have likely been emailed to everyone in the group - Loomio has no ability to delete those.</p>
<p>Deleting your account will <em>not</em> cancel your subscription; to stop your payments see <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/policy/subscriptions/management/#cancel-your-plan">Subscriptions</a>.</p>

<p>Loomio can send notifications to your chatroom!</p>
<p>Chat tools and Loomio work well together. Chat is like an open or 1:1 conversation in your office, and Loomio is like getting people together in a meeting room to discuss a particular topic and make a decision. </p>
<p>Loomio supports Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Matrix and Mattermost.</p>
<p>You can send notifications to your chatroom any time you like, just the same way you would invite individual people to vote, or to join a thread.</p>
<p>You can also configure notifications to always happen when a specific event happens, like someone starting a thread.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-looks-like-in-chat"><a class="header" href="#what-it-looks-like-in-chat">What it looks like in chat</a></h2>

<p>We've prepared step by step walk-throughs for each service we support. Follow the right one for your service to obtain the webhook URL you'll need to add the chatbot in Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="user_manual/groups/integrations/chatbots/../slack/">Slack</a></li>

<li><a href="user_manual/groups/integrations/chatbots/../mattermost/">Mattermost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our webhook based system can also be used to support other systems that support incoming webhooks with either HTML or Markdown formatting. This could be something like Zapier or Rocketchat.
Just select the mattermost bot, but use a custom webhook URL.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-setup-a-chatbot"><a class="header" href="#how-to-setup-a-chatbot">How to setup a chatbot</a></h2>
<p>After configuring your chosen service (see above), you'll have a webhook URL.

<p>Our Matrix integration is a little different to our other chat integrations - it does not use a webhook - we've built a custom bot client for this one.</p>
<p>You will need to create a matrix user for the bot to login as.</p>

<p>Good governance is more than a board meeting, it requires good communication before and after meetings.</p>
<p>This guide is intended to help you use Loomio in your board or committee, so you can stay connected between meetings, deal with urgent matters and reduce board admin.</p>
<ul>
<li>Continue governance between meetings</li>
<li>Use board meetings for issues that matter</li>
<li>Keep a detailed record</li>
</ul>
<p>Loomio is a versatile discussion and decision-making tool for collaborative boards and committees. </p>
<p>Following are some examples of common practices of boards and committees, and how to apply these in Loomio.</p>

<p>Good governance exists where an organization has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organization to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.</p>
<p><em>“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”</em> <a href="https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf">United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific</a>.</p>
<p>Underpinning all of these principles is the need for good communication.</p>
<p>Here are some or the challenges directors and boards experience:</p>
<ul>
<li>Getting directors together in person</li>
<li>Time available to consider important issues </li>
<li>Urgency of critical issues</li>
<li>Online video meeting fatigue</li>
<li>Directors in multiple, remote locations, sometimes with poor internet connectivity</li>
<li>Mixed governance practice and experience</li>
<li>Dealing with high volumes of transactional business </li>
</ul>
<p>Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion while documenting everything.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="prepare-for-a-meeting-1"><a class="header" href="#prepare-for-a-meeting-1">Prepare for a meeting</a></h1>
<p>Effective meetings are productive, inclusive, and collaborative - they improve engagement, help build strong relationships, establish alignment, make better and faster decisions, promote inclusion, facilitate creative thinking and innovation, are a great channel for feedback and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Use Loomio to plan an effective meeting; involve people from the outset, align towards the most important topics, and make better use of your precious time together.</p>
<p>There are several things you can do to make your next board or committee meeting effective...</p>

</ul>
<h2 id="meeting-focus-and-review-actions"><a class="header" href="#meeting-focus-and-review-actions">Meeting focus and review actions</a></h2>
<p>Establish a focus for the meeting, so you spend your precious time together talking about the most important topics.</p>
<p>Inviting members to contribute to the agenda helps everyone align, think about topics and energize for the meeting.</p>
<p>Actions:</p>
<ul>
<li>focus the meeting on the most important things,</li>
<li>follow up and talk to members about actions from previous meetings.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/meeting_prep.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="on-loomio"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Use a Loomio <strong>Thread</strong> to prepare for your meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>remind members about the meeting coming up,</li>
<li>invite comment about the most important things to focus on,</li>
<li>summarize actions from the previous meeting and ask for an update.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="agenda-and-notify"><a class="header" href="#agenda-and-notify">Agenda and notify</a></h2>
<p>Announce the meeting with a clear agenda. Attach papers, link to key documents and notify members. </p>
<p>This helps everyone prepare for the meeting, by reading the materials and thinking about topics of discussion and the decisions to be made.  Members are then more likely to arrive in context and ready for the meeting.</p>
<p>Actions: </p>
<ul>
<li>prepare agenda, documents, materials and board papers,</li>
<li>notify members of meeting and send materials.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/meeting_notify.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-1"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-1">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Use a Loomio <strong>Thread</strong> to prepare for your board meeting:</p>
<ul>
<li>state details of meeting,</li>
<li>attach or link agenda, documents and other meeting materials,</li>
<li>invite members with a notification,</li>
<li>monitor 'Seen by' to see who has read the thread.</li>
</ul>
<p>While similar to sending an email, a Loomio thread has advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li>you can see who has read the thread, and remind those who haven't,</li>
<li>member replies or comments are visible to everyone who has permission to view the thread,</li>
<li>any discussion or questions about the agenda or meeting materials is held in a single place.</li>
</ul>
<p>Members can find all the information about the meeting readily available in one place, thereby avoiding confusing email chains and losing important info in their email inbox.</p>
<h3 id="confirm"><a class="header" href="#confirm">Confirm</a></h3>
<p>A great way to confirm everyone is prepared for the meeting is to use an <strong>Opt-in</strong> poll.  Ask people to confirm they have read the agenda and meeting papers, and are coming to the meeting.</p>
<p>A Loomio poll lets everyone know that something is happening and their response is required.  It adds that extra level of participation and an encouragement to read and prepare for the meeting.  Members can also leave a comment when responding.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/meeting_agenda.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="find-a-time-for-meeting"><a class="header" href="#find-a-time-for-meeting">Find a time for meeting</a></h2>
<p>Finding a time to meet can be a frequent headache for many administrators. </p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-2"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-2">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>If you have not yet set a date and time for the meeting or you need to find a time for a future meeting, you can use <strong>Time poll</strong>.</p>
<p>Time poll makes it easy to see everyone's availability and find the best time, reducing time and energy needed for this common admin task.</p>
<p>Members in different time zones will see dates and times localized in their time zone.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/timepoll_vote.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the Time poll closes, choose the best time and send an outcome notification with a calendar invitation, so members can add the meeting to their calendar. </p>
<h2 id="sign-off-minutes"><a class="header" href="#sign-off-minutes">Sign off minutes</a></h2>
<p>Approving or ratifying minutes is standard practice for formal meetings and good practice for all meetings.</p>
<p>Minutes provide a record of the meeting, key points raised during discussion, results of decisions and how people voted. They include the actions agreed and the person(s) responsible, and are often the starting point for the next meeting.</p>
<p>Minutes are valuable as a reminder for people present, helpful for those absent and a record to consult in case of conflict.</p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-3"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-3">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Post the minutes in the Loomio meeting thread within a few days of the meeting and invite participants to approve.  This keeps the minutes relevant and fresh in member's minds and is a great way to remind members of their actions.  It also saves some time during your meeting.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/poll_minutes.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>The example above uses a <strong>Simple poll</strong> with two options 'Accept' or 'Review'.</p>
<p>When everyone has voted and the poll closes, state an outcome so everyone knows what has happened.</p>
<p>If your meeting practice requires formal acceptance at the next meeting, schedule an agenda item to acknowledge and confirm polls and decisions made on Loomio, and record this in the meeting minutes.</p>
<p>For example; <em>&quot;Does anyone wish to change their votes in Loomio?  If no, then let's resolve to formally approve polls made in Loomio during the last period.&quot;</em></p>
<h2 id="approve-reports"><a class="header" href="#approve-reports">Approve reports</a></h2>
<p>Most meeting agendas include time for reports to be presented, discussed and approved; for example reports from the CEO, Financial, Operations, Health &amp; Safety, and project reports.</p>
<p>Reports are very important to help everyone get on the same page, however they can absorb valuable time in a meeting that may be used more effectively.</p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-4"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-4">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Attach or link reports to your meeting <strong>thread</strong> and invite questions about the reports in advance of the meeting.</p>
<p>Members receive and read the reports at a time and place that works for them.  As members read and think about the reports, they can comment, ask questions and see responses in Loomio.</p>
<p>A question asked by one member is likely of interest to other members, so when someone replies to the question, their response  is visible to everyone in the Loomio group.</p>
<p>As members become familiar with discussing reports in Loomio, save a little more time by taking it a step further - seek approval of reports ahead of the meeting.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="facilitating-discussions"><a class="header" href="#facilitating-discussions">Facilitating discussions</a></h1>
<p>At times topics arise that require the attention of board or committee members mid-cycle, between meetings. </p>
<p>And sometimes there is just not space during a meeting for discussion or to sufficiently deliberate on a decision.</p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-5"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-5">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Use a Loomio <strong>thread</strong> to facilitate a discussion.  Give the thread a descriptive title that members will recognize and provide details in the thread context.  Add a relevant category tag to help members find the thread in future.</p>
<p>Notify members of the thread by inviting them, so they will receive a copy of the thread by email.  Members can participate in the discussion by clicking on the link to go to Loomio, or reply to the notification email and their comment will appear as a comment in the thread.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_discussion.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>A Loomio thread enables you to attach files or link to online resources to support the discussion.</p>
<p>Common examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>review and develop a policy</li>
<li>seek advice from the board about a topic or issue</li>
<li>discuss strategy </li>
<li>explore an idea or opportunity</li>
<li>assess risk</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="issues-that-arise-between-board-meetings"><a class="header" href="#issues-that-arise-between-board-meetings">Issues that arise between board meetings</a></h2>
<p>A lot can happen in an organization between meetings, and most people rely on email to alert board members.  Trying to keep track of a discussion on email is tricky, with replies often lost in in-boxes and people left out.</p>
<p><em>“You can’t do governance by email!”, Richard Westlake (Westlake Governance).</em></p>
<p>When an issue arises requiring board attention, use a Loomio thread rather than email.  Members can reply via email and their comment will appear in the Loomio thread, keeping the discussion in one place. </p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the email subject line the title of your thread,</li>
<li>write your email content in the thread context,</li>
<li>invite your team to the thread with their email address or Loomio user name.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Loomio thread means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All info about a topic is organized in one easily accessible place,</li>
<li>people can respond without generating reply/reply-all email chains that risk leaving people out,</li>
<li>you can see who has read the message and who needs a nudge,</li>
<li>you can progress actual work to an outcome, and cut down on the amount of email.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="when-there-isnt-space-during-meetings"><a class="header" href="#when-there-isnt-space-during-meetings">When there isn't space during meetings</a></h2>
<p>When an agenda item cannot be resolved within the time available in your board meeting, you can move this for further discussion to Loomio. Direct people to the relevant thread, or start a new one and notify your board members.</p>
<p>This relieves pressure on your board, allows more time for information gathering, discussion and deeper reflection which often results in a better quality decision.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_topic.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="making-resolutions-and-online-decisions"><a class="header" href="#making-resolutions-and-online-decisions">Making resolutions and online decisions</a></h1>
<p>Board and committee members frequently need to make 'out-of-session' decisions. These are governance decisions and discussion where either;</p>
<ul>
<li>There was insufficient time to make a decision in the board meeting,</li>
<li>the decision does not require a lot of discussion (including administrative decisions),</li>
<li>something has happened (internally or externally) that requires the board to act before the next meeting,</li>
<li>a director has a particular interest to explore with the board.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="on-loomio-6"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-6">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Start a <strong>thread</strong> and open a discussion:</p>
<ul>
<li>Introduce the topic or decision that you would like to make,</li>
<li>invite directors to comment with their thoughts, opinions and any information they have to help everyone understand their perspective about the 'out-of-session' topic or decision,</li>
<li>encourage members to participate by posting or reply to comments.</li>
</ul>
<p>When ready, raise a <strong>poll</strong> and invite members to vote. 
If the issue is straightforward use a <strong>Proposal</strong> or if the issue is more complex use a <strong>Sense check</strong> poll to clearly ask fellow members how they feel about the proposal.</p>
<ul>
<li>State the decision and invite people to vote,</li>
<li>ask people to leave a reason for their vote, particularly if they want to qualify any points,</li>
<li>choose the decision options that work for your board's decision-making processes.</li>
<li>You can ratify and minute the 'out-of-session' decision at your next board meeting.</li>
</ul>
<p>It's not a failure if a decision does not get agreement. You can ask members what changes they would make to enable them to agree to a decision. This helps you build to a better decision. A new Proposal with amendments is then more likely to achieve agreement.</p>
<p>State an <strong>outcome</strong> when the proposal closes. Let everyone know the result of the decision and what will happen next.</p>

<p>At the last board meeting, a property purchase was discussed. A director required an independent engineering report before making the decision. At the board meeting, the board agreed to purchase the property subject to a satisfactory engineering report. However as the purchase must be made before the next board meeting, the board agreed to upload the engineering report to Loomio when ready, for discussion and to make the final decision for the property purchase on Loomio.</p>

<p>During the board meeting it was noted that the annual insurance renewal was coming up. As this was considered to be an administrative matter, the board agreed to use Loomio to discuss the renewal application, seek the required information from each director, submit the application and to accept the insurance renewal quote.</p>

<h2 id="keeping-a-record-of-decisions-made-and-supporting-discussion"><a class="header" href="#keeping-a-record-of-decisions-made-and-supporting-discussion">Keeping a record of decisions made and supporting discussion</a></h2>
<p>Record keeping is a legal requirement for governance boards and good practice for committees.</p>
<p>Today, many organizations record and store formal minutes, resolutions, policies and key decisions electronically. Document records are created and approved, distributed and used, retained and stored, and ultimately disposed of.</p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-7"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-7">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Minutes, reports, resolutions and other documents can be attached to a meeting <strong>thread</strong>, in the thread context, within a poll or any to thread comment.  This means the documents are always associated with the relevant discussion.</p>
<p>A list of files can also be found under the <strong>Files</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/files_tab.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can also add a link within any thread or poll to a document stored in your preferred document management system.  Find the online shareable link to the document, copy and paste into your thread, poll or comment.</p>
<p>Anyone with permission can then click the link to open and read the document.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_link.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>Because Loomio discussions and decisions are always already documented, it provides a robust way to verify all your board's decision-making. You can easily demonstrate what was decided, and when. If directors have discussed and commented, as well as voted on a resolution—you will also know how and why each decision was reached.</p>
<p>Over time, you are creating a history for your organization where you can easily search and find past decisions and related discussion.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_search.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>In Loomio all data is written and stored on multiple disks and multiple locations, <em>in the cloud</em>, backed up daily.  Files uploaded are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="governance-practices-and-approaches"><a class="header" href="#governance-practices-and-approaches">Governance practices and approaches</a></h1>
<p>Good governance includes establishing, reviewing and challenging governance practices, policies and procedures to continously improve board effectiveness.</p>
<p>However many boards are short on time and often weighed down by board papers, compliance and risk, without sufficient time to discuss and debate critical strategy and performance issues.</p>
<h3 id="on-loomio-8"><a class="header" href="#on-loomio-8">On Loomio</a></h3>
<p>Loomio offers the opportunity to work online on a document, policy or procedure.  Discussion and decisions are contained in a thread that members can access when and wherever works for them.</p>
<p>Use a <strong>thread</strong> for each document, policy or procedure. The thread is the container for discussion, and holds document drafts and subsequent versions of the document.</p>
<p>With a Loomio thread, you can organize so that the 2-3 people working on the document text are discussing particulars in the thread.  The thread could be private amongst just those 2-3 people, or run openly in the group so that the work is transparent to all members.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/document_introduce.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>When the document reaches a draft version, use a <strong>Sense check poll</strong> to notify members that the draft document is ready for review, and invite members to read the document and respond with any comments or questions.  As well as letting everyone know that the work is progressing, the poll closing date encourages people to participate.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/document_integrate.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>The document may require several draft iterations.</p>
<p>When a 'final' draft is ready, raise a <strong>Proposal</strong> to approve the document.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/document_approval.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>Loomio enables a board to progress work on governance improvement between meetings without eating into precious time in meetings.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="administration-and-record-keeping"><a class="header" href="#administration-and-record-keeping">Administration and record keeping</a></h1>
<p>Admin and keeping good records for audit is an important, and often legal requirement for your board or committee. </p>
<p>Increasingly, electronic records are supplanting the requirement for paper.</p>
<p>However digital tools enable your board to do much more than just file meeting minutes.</p>
<p>Transform your board: </p>
<p><em>“Our board group has been particularly transformative, enabling continuous governance, improving response times and increasing our agility, resilience and sustainability… Loomio saves us thousands of pounds every year”</em></p>
<ul>

</ul>
<p>Let's look at how to organize work, administer threads, keep data safe and store records in Loomio.</p>
<h2 id="administering-threads"><a class="header" href="#administering-threads">Administering threads</a></h2>
<p>There is a range of features in Loomio to help you administer threads accessible from the drop down menu to the right of the thread.</p>
<p>Keep the thread list current by using:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Pin thread</strong> to keep important threads at the top of the list</li>
<li><strong>Edit thread</strong> to change thread title or update thread context</li>
<li><strong>Move to group</strong> when you want to move a thread to another group or subgroup, or to an archive group. </li>
<li><strong>Close thread</strong> to remove the thread from the list.  Closed threads are easily available under the thread drop down menu and from the search bar, and can be reopened at any time.</li>
<li><strong>Delete thread</strong> when you do not want to keep a record of the thread.  Note that deleted threads can not be un-deleted.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_admin.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="category-tags-2"><a class="header" href="#category-tags-2">Category tags</a></h2>
<p>Category tags are a great way to label threads so they can be easily found. Set tags and apply to each thread  - try to be consistent.</p>
<p>Common board tags include: Administration, AGM, Board meeting, Report, Finance, Legal, Members, Minutes, Planning, Policy, Resolution, Constitution, General meeting, Strategy.</p>
<p>Group members can search for threads by tag under the <strong>tags</strong> drop down menu.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_tags.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="maintaining-the-thread-topic"><a class="header" href="#maintaining-the-thread-topic">Maintaining the thread topic</a></h2>
<p>Threads work best for everyone when you can keep the thread on a single topic. </p>
<p>If a new topic is introduced in the middle of a thread, you can select and move specific comments to another thread, or start a new thread.</p>
<p><img src="guides/board_processes/thread_comments_move.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="subgroups-1"><a class="header" href="#subgroups-1">Subgroups</a></h2>
<p>Subgroups help you organize your communications and members so that the right people are engaged in their work together.  For example, you can use a subgroup for a subcommittee or working group.</p>

<h2 id="archiving-records"><a class="header" href="#archiving-records">Archiving records</a></h2>
<p>To keep a record of a thread discussion and decisions in polls, use <strong><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/data_export/index.html#print-thread-to-pdf">Print thread</a></strong> and print the file to pdf.  You can then store a published copy of the thread in your chosen document storage archive.</p>

<h2 id="data-storage"><a class="header" href="#data-storage">Data storage</a></h2>
<p>Loomio's cloud services protect your data by writing to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple locations.</p>
<p>All data in threads, comments, polls and file attachments are stored in this way.</p>
<p>Files attached to threads can also be seen under the Files tab.</p>

<p>Loomio can become the online place where your board or committee meet, discuss, decide and build an auditable record for your organization.</p>
<p>However Loomio will be of little value if only some of your board participate.  Information and communication will likely remain scattered over multiple tools, lost in email inboxes and the confusion will waste everyone's time.</p>
<p>We recommend you commit as a board to move to Loomio, and everyone makes a genuine effort.</p>
<p>As administrator your primary objective is to set up Loomio effectively for your board.</p>
<p>Aim to encourage directors to join and participate. They should be easily able to:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sign in to Loomio</li>
<li>Read and comment on threads</li>
<li>Vote in polls</li>
<li>See how your governance practices work in Loomio</li>
</ul>

<p><em>Improve remote and formal meetings with this Loomio guide.</em></p>
<p>In times of instability and uncertainty, and especially now, we can’t always gather in the same place at the same time. But life goes on and many organizations are still needing to continue running their big or formal meetings, to discuss and <a href="guides/virtual_agm/../virtual_board_meetings">make decisions as a board</a> or even run an AGM.</p>
<p>This guide will help keep your business moving even while you can’t gather in person by helping you run productive AGMs, assemblies, and other big, formal or infrequent meetings.</p>
<h2 id="what-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin"><a class="header" href="#what-you-need-to-know-before-you-begin">What you need to know before you begin</a></h2>
<p>Before we begin, we will make a couple points about the tools you might need and why, and then help you run your next meeting step-by-step with Loomio’s communication and decision-making platform.</p>
<h3 id="real-time-is-not-always-best"><a class="header" href="#real-time-is-not-always-best">Real-time is not always best</a></h3>
<p>You can have some or even all of the interactions and engagement you would normally have at a formal meeting on Loomio. Loomio may not be the only tool you want to use – we also use <a href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi</a>'s open source teleconferencing, or Zoom, and Google Drive for file sharing – but it can help you and your group to reduce real-time meetings by achieving some decisions or processes solely on Loomio.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Example:</strong> This investment group prefers to meet online rather than in-person to discuss their <a href="https://blog.loomio.com/2019/06/14/investing-in-community/#our-most-essential-tool">loan allocation</a> process.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It can also help you continue communication between meetings, better prepare for meetings,  and keep a good record of decisions, actions and accountabilities and follow-ups all in one place.</p>
<p>We know that using video conferencing can be incredibly important for quality discussions as some communications do require higher bandwidth. However, we believe all groups can benefit by doing some of their processes <strong>asynchronously</strong>, which can be understood as ‘on participants’ own time’ ( think mail or bulletin boards – read and written by people at a time that is convenient for them).</p>
<p>This type of communication can help you alleviate the time pressure in meetings, video-call fatigue, and scheduling nightmares. It often allows for more thoughtful conversation and considerate decisions, with time to ‘sleep on it.’</p>
<h3 id="agm-vs-general-assemblies-vs-board-meetings"><a class="header" href="#agm-vs-general-assemblies-vs-board-meetings">AGM vs. General Assemblies vs. Board meetings…</a></h3>
<p>Quick note: We’re using the example of an AGM to show how we can <strong>achieve the purpose of big, formal meetings</strong> remotely and efficiently. Your board or other formal meeting might follow all of these steps, or find a few of the tips are less necessary. Routine processes – such as  a <a href="https://blog.loomio.com/2019/06/19/funding-community-renewable-projects/" title="open in new tab">grant funding process</a> – are easy to operationalize with Loomio.</p>

<p><strong><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/starting_a_group/" title="open in new tab">Prepare your group</a></strong> with a group description for your members to welcome them and outline how you plan to use Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Consider what type of decisions you will make in this AGM and how this fits with your organization’s constitution and legal compliance.</li>
<li>Be clear who is involved and what people can expect of one another.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set your group privacy to Secret so only members of your AGM can see it and participate in discussions.</p>

<h3 id="2-start-a-discussion-thread-for-your-agm"><a class="header" href="#2-start-a-discussion-thread-for-your-agm">2. Start a discussion thread for your AGM</a></h3>
<p><strong>A month before your meeting, start a <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/threads/starting_threads/" title="open in new tab">discussion thread</a></strong> to announce the AGM details. Include the video conferencing link, date and time in every key piece of communication.</p>
<img src="guides/virtual_agm/all_you_need_to_know_for_agm.png" class="border-orange">
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>Some groups run their AGMs entirely on Loomio, without a video call at all.</em></p>
<p><strong>Attach the meeting materials and include the agenda</strong> and any key documents, links, and files so that people have them all in one place. Putting this information in the thread’s context, which always remains at the top of the discussion, makes it easy for everyone to find it.</p>
<p>You may also invite members to ask questions prior to the meeting. This is helpful to gain some insight into any concerns or what people are thinking, so everyone can be better prepared for the upcoming meeting.</p>
<p><strong>Decide on roles</strong> – who will serve as 'technical support' and 'facilitator' or 'host' – and let people know how to reach them (how to <a href="guides/virtual_agm//en/user_manual/threads/notifying_people/#mentioning-people">@mention</a> them on Loomio, phone numbers, email addresses, etc.) in this thread context.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Send people calendar invites to ensure they have reminders in their calendars.</p>
<h3 id="3-invite-people-in"><a class="header" href="#3-invite-people-in">3. Invite people in</a></h3>
<p>First give participants access to the group or subgroup:</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the MEMBERS tab and click INVITE</li>
<li>If they were not already a part of your group, copy and paste participants’ emails</li>
</ul>
<p>Immediately after that, send them the details so they know why they’ve been invited</p>
<ul>
<li>Go to the thread you just started</li>
<li>Click <strong>members</strong></li>
<li>Again, if they were not already a part of your group, copy and paste all their email addresses into the invite box.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>You’ve got your group started! Great! Before we move on,</strong> here is a quick overview of Loomio’s great tools for facilitating and achieving better decisions…</p>

<h3 id="4-use-checks-to-be-better-prepared"><a class="header" href="#4-use-checks-to-be-better-prepared">4. Use ‘Checks’ to be better prepared</a></h3>
<p>Use a <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposal_types/index.html#check">Check poll</a> (yes or no) from within a thread to raise everyone’s preparedness. For example:</p>
<img src="guides/virtual_agm/preparing_with_check_polls.png" class="border-orange">
<p><strong>Clarify what is expected of participants.</strong> Do they need to read reports or any important documents before the meeting? Will their input shape the agenda?</p>
<p>Inviting participants' input can help surface important information. This also lets you know who’s prepared and who has seen reminders.</p>
<p>You can also prepare by getting input, or even completing some decisions on Loomio.</p>

<p><em>Step-by-step to improve board meetings &amp; simplify other board work.</em></p>
<p>In times of crisis, good governance and clear communication within your board are more important than ever. However, doing this can be challenging when some or all of your board members are remote. In these times, many groups have been asking not just <a href="guides/virtual_board_meetings/../virtual_agm">how to hold their Annual General Meeting</a> (AGM, GMM…), but how to keep  organization moving by moving some decisions and regular meeting practices onto Loomio.</p>
<p>In this guide, you will learn how to:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Run a virtual board meeting in a way that is truly effective – giving everyone a voice, working through all the items on the agenda and creating space for meaningful discussions.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Ensure quality governance by preparing your board in advance, dealing with administrative matters, and giving members time to consider important issues and make better decisions.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>So, let’s dig in.</p>
<h2 id="building-your-online-communication-toolkit"><a class="header" href="#building-your-online-communication-toolkit">Building your online communication toolkit</a></h2>
<p>Key principles of good governance include; participation, equity, a voice in decision making, transparency, accountability, responsiveness, board consensus and strategic leadership. Underpinning all of these principles is good communication.</p>
<p>So what happens when you can’t meet in person? How do you maintain clear communication channels then?</p>
<p>Firstly, you will need to consider the tools you will need to help members communicate and record decisions made.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio works well alongside real time video conference tools like <a href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi</a> (open source, privacy-oriented), Zoom, or Skype, as well as tools for sharing or storing files.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="video-conferencing"><a class="header" href="#video-conferencing">Video Conferencing</a></h3>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://meet.jit.si">Jitsi</a> or Zoom video conferencing is great for meeting together online, assuming everyone is equipped with a camera, microphone and a broadband internet service</li>
<li>However it can still be hard to get everyone together at the same time</li>
<li>to keep attention in the face of other distractions at home or office</li>
<li>and the concentration required for members can be exhausting - <em>how do you feel in long, back-to-back calls?</em></li>
<li>Real time video conferencing is best kept focused and to a minimum.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="document-storage"><a class="header" href="#document-storage">Document Storage</a></h3>
<ul>
<li>For board documents, agenda and records, consider using document and file repository tools like dedicated board document management tools, Google Docs and Sharepoint.</li>
<li>Just bear in mind that you will still need to discuss and comment on the documents.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="communicating-between-board-meetings"><a class="header" href="#communicating-between-board-meetings">Communicating Between Board Meetings</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>“You can’t do governance by email!” says Richard Westlake (Westlake Governance)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Using Loomio cuts unnecessary email discussions, where documents get lost, people are missed in the conversation and confusion can result.</p>
<p>A Loomio group is a secure online place for your board. A Loomio group helps you increase communication and continue work between meetings; connecting your members wherever they are and at a time that suits them.</p>
<p>Every member can access, contribute to discussions, create proposals, take part in decisions and see what has been decided already.</p>
<p>Get your board started with Loomio in less than 10 minutes with these five simple steps:</p>
<ol>
<li>Set up your group</li>
<li>Invite board members</li>
<li>Start a thread for your next board meeting</li>
<li>Agree on the agenda</li>
<li>Set an outcome</li>
</ol>
<p>These steps are detailed below with some examples. It is a great way to help your board members prepare for the teleconference meeting, while becoming familiar with Loomio.</p>
<h2 id="preparing-for-your-virtual-board-meeting"><a class="header" href="#preparing-for-your-virtual-board-meeting">Preparing for your virtual Board meeting</a></h2>
<h3 id="1-set-up-your-group-1"><a class="header" href="#1-set-up-your-group-1">1. Set up your group</a></h3>
<p>First, <a href="https://www.loomio.com/g/new/?utm_campaign=virtual_board_guide&amp;utm_term=help">click here</a> to start a new organization on Loomio if you haven't already. If you are considering using Loomio in other parts of your organization, I suggest setting up a <a href="guides/virtual_board_meetings//en/user_manual/groups/subgroups">subgroup</a> for your board.</p>
<p>Edit group settings to add your Group description, so your board understands how you plan to use Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li>Write a clear purpose statement explaining why you have set up this group and a reason why people should join.</li>
<li>Consider what type of decisions you will make in this group and how this fits with your organization’s constitution and legal compliance.</li>
<li>Be clear about who is involved and what is expected of each member.</li>
</ul>
<p>Set group privacy to secret so only members of your board can see and participate.</p>
<img src="guides/virtual_board_meetings/virtual_board_group_description.png" class="border-orange">
<h3 id="2-invite-team-members"><a class="header" href="#2-invite-team-members">2. Invite team members</a></h3>
<p>Invite board members to your new Loomio group with an email invitation.</p>
<ol>
<li>On your group page go to the MEMBERS tab</li>
<li>Click INVITE</li>
<li>Paste in email addresses and SEND.</li>
</ol>
<p>Participants will receive an invitation email with a link to the group. When they accept, a new Loomio user account will be created and they can participate in board discussions straight away.</p>

<p>A week before your meeting, start a discussion thread to announce the details of your meeting.</p>
<p>Click NEW THREAD from your <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/users/navigation/?utm_campaign=virtual_board_guide&amp;utm_term=help/#group-pages/">group page</a>.</p>
<p>Give the thread a clear title, and explain in the ‘context’ section what this particular thread is about.</p>
<p>Attach board documents and include all relevant details, like links and files, so that people have them all in one place.</p>
<p>Putting this information in the thread’s context, which always remains at the top of the discussion, makes it easy for everyone to find.</p>
<p>Invite members to ask any questions prior to the meeting. This is helpful to gain insights about what people are thinking, so everyone can be better prepared for the actual board meeting.</p>
<img src="guides/virtual_board_meetings/start_thread_for_your_board_meeting.png" class="border-orange">
<h3 id="4-agree-on-the-agenda"><a class="header" href="#4-agree-on-the-agenda">4. Agree on the agenda</a></h3>
<p>Invite board members to read board papers and submit any agenda items. This is a great way to confirm everyone is prepared for the meeting.</p>
<p>Use a <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposal_types/#check">Check poll</a> to request a response. Set it to close before the time the meeting starts; so that everyone will get a reminder 24 hours beforehand.</p>

<h2 id="during-your-meeting"><a class="header" href="#during-your-meeting">During your meeting</a></h2>
<p>Run the board meeting at the appointed time on Jitsi or Zoom as usual, following the agreed agenda and accessing board papers as needed.</p>
<p>Chairing a remote board meeting takes real energy. Richard Westlake observes;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>First, you’re managing the process of the meeting. To most people, this is your main role.</em></li>
<li><em>Second, you’re still a director – not just a facilitator.</em></li>
<li><em>Third, as chair, you can’t afford to miss a beat: you need your antennae up the whole time, to know who should speak, who shouldn’t, and when to move on.</em></li>
</ul>
<p><a href="https://chairingtheboard.com/2020/04/01/chairing-in-the-time-of-physical-separation-six-tips-for-chairing-remote-board-meetings/?utm_campaign=virtual_board_guide&amp;utm_term=help/">Read Richard’s six tips for chairing a remote board meeting.</a></p>
<p>You may find that some parts of your meeting are already reduced by using Loomio to help members arrive better prepared. For example, the minutes of the previous meeting already agreed on Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li>During the meeting, minutes can be taken as usual or written directly into a Loomio thread.</li>
<li>Members may add comments in the agenda or discussion topic threads within Loomio.</li>
<li>You may run a decision and record votes within Loomio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here are a few practices we find helpful, when using Loomio:</p>
<ol>
<li>Checking in together</li>
<li>Ratify decisions made on Loomio</li>
<li>Extend discussion on topics between meetings</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-check-ins"><a class="header" href="#1-check-ins">1. Check-ins</a></h3>
<p>Checking in with each other is always good practice – even more so when you are in a virtual meeting.</p>
<p>A quick check-in round where everyone has the opportunity to briefly say something – a personal experience and/or comment relevant to the business at hand – helps people to focus on the matters at hand and reveals if there’s any special circumstances that need attending to.</p>
<p><a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/facilitators_guide/commencing/#check-in">You can even run check-ins on Loomio</a>.</p>
<h3 id="2-ratify-decisions-made-on-loomio"><a class="header" href="#2-ratify-decisions-made-on-loomio">2. Ratify decisions made on Loomio</a></h3>
<p>If your constitution or legal requirement does not provide for online decision-making, you can note and ratify any decisions you have made in Loomio since the last board meeting.</p>
<p>We find it helpful to recognize decisions made on Loomio in the formal meeting minutes.</p>
<h3 id="3-extend-discussion-on-topics-between-meetings"><a class="header" href="#3-extend-discussion-on-topics-between-meetings">3. Extend discussion on topics between meetings</a></h3>
<p>When an agenda item cannot be resolved within the time available in your board meeting, you can move this for further discussion to Loomio. Direct people to the relevant thread, or start a new one and notify your board members.</p>
<p>This relieves pressure on your board, allows more time for information gathering, discussion and deeper reflection which often results in a better quality decision.</p>

<h2 id="after-your-board-meeting"><a class="header" href="#after-your-board-meeting">After your Board meeting</a></h2>
<p>Now that you have completed your first Board meeting with Loomio, here are some next steps to try:</p>
<ol>
<li>Agree or ratify minutes</li>
<li>Make a decision between meetings</li>
<li>Agree a time for your next meeting</li>
<li>Review history and build an auditable archive</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1-agree-or-ratify-minutes"><a class="header" href="#1-agree-or-ratify-minutes">1. Agree or ratify minutes</a></h3>
<p>After the meeting, update the meeting thread with a summary of what was discussed and note what action items were agreed on.</p>
<p>Create another <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/proposal_types/#check">Check poll</a> in the same thread, and attach or link to the meeting minutes document. Give people a few days to sign off the minutes and confirm their action points.</p>

<h3 id="2-make-a-decision-between-meetings"><a class="header" href="#2-make-a-decision-between-meetings">2. Make a decision between meetings</a></h3>
<p>You can use Loomio to make a decision between meetings.</p>
<p>Save valuable time in meetings by pushing administrative decisions onto Loomio, such as approving an insurance renewal.</p>
<p>Loomio is also great for making time-sensitive decisions when action is needed before your next board meeting. For example, you may need to approve a special budget change, to deal with a problem or take advantage of an opportunity.</p>
<ol>
<li>Start a thread and open a discussion with clear context, relevant information and your request.</li>
<li>When ready, raise a <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/starting_proposals">Proposal</a>, and invite members to vote. You will soon hear if members need more information to vote.</li>

<p>An in-depth guide to applying key facilitation concepts in the online space.</p>
<p>Loomio is made by facilitators, and that plays a huge role in how it has been designed. This guide is about revealing more of that context, and translating facilitation concepts from the offline space to the online space.</p>
<h2 id="more-about-this-guide"><a class="header" href="#more-about-this-guide">More about this guide</a></h2>
<p>Whether employed by a professional facilitator, people peer-facilitating each other, or a group that has no awareness of facilitation at all, Loomio’s essential function is to mediate and support group communication toward a desired outcome. In other words, facilitation.</p>
<p>Loomio is <em>groupware</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Collaborative software, or groupware, is designed to help people involved in a common task achieve their goals. One of the earliest definitions of collaborative software is “intentional group processes plus software to support them.” -- Wikipedia</p>
</blockquote>
<p>There is a huge body of knowledge, best practice, and tradition in both in-person facilitation and online moderation, but the art and science of their intersection is only just emerging. This is the specific space where Loomio strives to excel.</p>

<p>Hi! I'm Alanna.</p>
<p>I'm one of the founders of Loomio, and I've been thinking deeply about how it works from a facilitation perspective since the beginning. I am not a seminal facilitation expert; I consider myself only a beginner in this craft that one could spend a lifetime honing.</p>
<p>What I can offer is help translating between the offline and online spaces, as a practitioner in both. I've facilitated a lot of groups who use Loomio, and learned from their experiences.</p>
<p>You can find out <a href="http://alanna.space">more about me on my website</a>.</p>
<p>I'm only one person, with one perspective and approach to facilitation, when there are myriad approaches. I've tried to bring in a couple other facilitator's voices here, including <a href="http://richdecibels.com/">Rich</a> from Loomio and Silvia from <a href="http://exp.agency">EXP</a>.</p>

<h2 id="understand-purpose"><a class="header" href="#understand-purpose">Understand Purpose</a></h2>
<p>Clarification of purpose is one of the highest value offerings of a skilled facilitator — if they can help the group nail that, everything else is possible. Purpose operates at the level of a group as a whole, and at the level of individual discussions/decisions. Purpose is what enables judgment calls about what tools to deploy, what interventions to enact, and what outcomes to aim for. Lack of shared understanding about purpose can be fatal to a discussion, or to the group itself.</p>

<p>Always refer back to your purpose-finding questions to check that you’re covering off what the participants want to learn or achieve. — Silvia Zuur</p>

<li>The app offers space for explication of purpose, such as the <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation//en/user_manual/groups/starting_a_group#group-description">group description</a> and <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation//en/user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/#thread-context">discussion context</a> fields.</li>
<li>A Loomio discussion <em>about</em> purpose is a great place to start with your group, if it's not already clear.</li>
<li>Our analytics (stats about how people use the software) show that groups with a clear shared purpose are more successful.</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.loomio.com/?utm_campaign=facilitators_guide_help&amp;utm_term=help">Customer stories and case studies</a> we've collected emphasise the importance of setting a collective purpose.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="rearrange-the-furniture"><a class="header" href="#rearrange-the-furniture">Rearrange the Furniture</a></h2>
<p>Desiging the space you invite people into greatly influences their experience. Every gathering is unique, and deserves a setup to suit. Familiarity signals safety, while changing the environment cues openness to new ideas.</p>
<p>In offline spaces, literally rearranging the furniture is a habit that helps facilitators get into the right zone to hold space, and prompts them to think about what’s unique in that session. Imagine the difference between everyone seated in rows versus everyone in a circle.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Inviting people into a new digital space specifically for decision making is powerful — there’s a “threshold crossing” experience making it as distinct from other online spaces (which might be for socialising or other functions).</li>
<li><a href="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation//en/user_manual/groups/starting_a_group#upload-a-group-photo">Customising your group photo</a> is a prime opportunity to craft the feeling of the space.</li>
<li>The group description is a main piece of “furniture” on the group page, and <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation//en/user_manual/groups/starting_a_group#group-description">you can customise it</a> to suit.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="supplies-tools-materials"><a class="header" href="#supplies-tools-materials">Supplies, Tools, Materials</a></h2>
<p>When facilitation is running smoothly, all the supplies a group needs are right at hand. In offline spaces, this stuff includes post-its, pens, paper, name tags, printouts, and background material. Every step a facilitator takes to be well-prepared in this way allows more time and energy for the work.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Many groups use the group description to link to a shared drive of collaborative documents, background information, the group's project management or task tracking system, a list of contacts, etc.</li>
<li>Each thread deserves consideration of what people might need to engage with it — putting all the information right at hand is essential (for example, if you reference something, linking directly to it is much more effective than expecting people to search for it).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="design-the-experience"><a class="header" href="#design-the-experience">Design the Experience</a></h2>
<p>Once they have the basic pieces in place (purpose, tools, background info), good facilitators take time to think through the design of the experience they are inviting: the situation, what success could look like, all the possible pathways and choices. They don’t jump in without a considered design.</p>
<p>Time and time again we have seen people drastically underestimate the need for prep and design. Stop and think about the experience you want to host, before jumping straight in. Investment in design is paid back many times over by success later.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio’s most basic functionality follows the structure of good facilitation by design: invite people, discuss a topic, gather divergent input, converge into a specific proposal, test for agreement, confirm outcome.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation/../collaboration-process.png" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li>Skilled users are already adapting Loomio for various experience designs — such as a multi-step consultation processes, signing off documents, etc. Each job, when facilitated effectively, takes a certain repeatable shape.</li>
<li>Online collaboration design doesn't have to reinvent the wheel. Trust what you know works, and translate it. Many tried and tested offline processes can be adapted to the online space (ex: the <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/preparation//en/guides/advice_process">Advice Process</a>).</li>
<li><a href="https://blog.loomio.com/?utm_campaign=facilitators_guide_help&amp;utm_term=help">Case studies</a> of thoughtfully designed processes could be used as “recipes” — if you're not sure what design to use, start by seeing what others have tried.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="contextualise-the-moment"><a class="header" href="#contextualise-the-moment">Contextualise the Moment</a></h2>
<p>Discussions do not occur in a vacuum, but in the larger context of the group’s history and practice. To be effective, facilitated experiences have to occur with the right timing, and fit in with the rest of the group’s process.</p>
<p>Key Context Questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Is this a moment of transition?</li>
<li>Is this an enhancement of existing practice?</li>
<li>Is this one of many concurrent processes, or a singular focus?</li>
<li>Are we here to solve a problem, or go deeper, wider, narrower?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio groups nearly always have a “champion”, who understands the group’s context and makes the call about whether introducing Loomio is right for them.</li>
<li>It's not wise to try to change everything at once. Any time Loomio fits nicely into existing workflows, groups will adopt it better.</li>
<li>Good timing is when the group is ready to incorporate online collaborative practice effectively. They have to feel the pain of not having the online decision-making space, and be motivated to solve that problem.</li>
<li>Consider the group’s attention economy to determine when the right time to raise a given topic might be. Collective attention is a limited resource.</li>
<li>Many groups are not even cognisant of their existing collaborative practice and habits, much less clear about how Loomio might fit in. Start with a discussion about the current way of doing things, and what's working or not working.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-role-of-the-facilitator"><a class="header" href="#the-role-of-the-facilitator">The Role of the Facilitator</a></h2>
<p>Good facilitation requires self-awareness on an individual and collective level. Lack of understanding of the role can lead to misunderstandings, conflict, or unsafe situations.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Have the power handed over to you. When you’re invited into a new group or organization, everybody will be thinking: Who’s this joker? Why should we listen to them? Get somebody who the participants know and trust to introduce you. This builds you up in the participants' minds and helps to hand over the power over to you. — Silvia Zuur</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="consent"><a class="header" href="#consent">Consent</a></h3>
<p>It’s critical that the group consents to be facilitated. Attempting to facilitate otherwise can be at worst coercive (unfair to the group) and dangerous (unfair to the facilitator) — and will face resistance and confusion. Facilitators put themselves in a vulnerable position; they must have mandate or they should not agree to engage. Consent is critical for both the facilitator and participants.</p>
<h3 id="responsibility"><a class="header" href="#responsibility">Responsibility</a></h3>
<p>Once a facilitator takes up a mandate, they carry enhanced responsibilities. Facilitators have more claim to floor time, and directing the group’s attention. This has to be used in service to the whole, not for a personal agenda. The words and demeanor of the facilitator will also have a disproportionate effect, meaning they have to act with heightened consideration.</p>
<h3 id="power"><a class="header" href="#power">Power</a></h3>
<p>Facilitation by nature introduces power differentials. If the facilitator cannot exercise power in certain ways, they cannot do their job. For example, to keep a discussion on topic the facilitator might interrupt someone, or say that a certain way of interacting is not OK. It’s not appropriate to expect a facilitator to shoulder responsibility for the experience without giving them the powers they need to deliver successfully. There is no one right answer about how much power, but it has to be balanced with the level of responsibility.</p>
<h3 id="responsiveness"><a class="header" href="#responsiveness">Responsiveness</a></h3>
<p>Facilitators do their best work when they can adapt effectively to the emergent reality. Human beings are endlessly complex, and groups of them exponentially more so. Rigid adherence to a plan or protocol without flexibility can set the group up to fail. If a facilitator is not allowed or not willing to adapt to changing circumstance, they cannot effectively hold the space for dynamic humans.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Wear and un-wear the facilitation-hat. A challenge many people face is trying to facilitate meetings and workshops with their own team. As a facilitator, they need to be neutral. But as a team member, they have valuable insights to share. Make it really clear when you’re a facilitator and when you’re being a participant. — Silvia Zuur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Many groups using Loomio are experienced with facilitation and already have a shared understanding of the role. They already adapt the tool to meet these needs with some success.</li>
<li>Often the person who starts a discussion is assumed to be facilitating it, barring another agreed understanding in the group. Clarity about who is facilitating can greatly enhance mutual safety and success.</li>
<li>Loomio naturally creates a dynamic and open to distributed acts of facilitation, such as users tagging in others, requests to stay on topic, suggestions of the right timing for a proposal, etc — but this is often left implicit. Explicitly naming what acts of facilitation are and discussing whether this role is centralised or distributed can clarify the role.</li>
<li>Implicit distributed facilitation can be the default starting place for an online group (ie, no discussion of facilitation as a named role), but that setup is actually best for advanced groups prgressing past working with explicit facilitation.</li>

<h2 id="invitation"><a class="header" href="#invitation">Invitation</a></h2>
<p>How participants are invited into a facilitated space is incredibly important. People understand huge amounts of information from the invitation, and use it to judge how a space will be held and if they belong there. The moment of invitation is in many ways the defining opportunity to set the tone and establish trust.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="border-radius: 100%; float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; max-width: 96px; " src="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing/../rich_200.png"> Decision making is all about communication: your group can only make good decisions together if there’s a foundation of good communication in place first. This means being clear about what the purpose of a discussion or meeting is, who needs to be involved, what the time-frame is, and what people can expect.</p>
<p>— Richard Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Key aspects to an invitation:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Background.</strong> What is this thing? What am I being asked to do? Who is behind this? Who else will be involved? What is the time commitment, topic focus, and protocol?</li>
<li><strong>Context.</strong> What is the character of this specific engagement? Of all the possible formats and ways it could go, which one will it be? Why now, why this way?</li>
<li><strong>Belonging.</strong> Am I welcome? Is this for me? Am I needed in this process? What is my unique value and contribution? Why should I specifically be compelled?</li>
<li><strong>Safety.</strong> Does this invitation indicate thoughtfulness, trust, and understanding? Is the structure of the engagement up to handling the inherent power dynamics at play? What level of honesty or vulnerability will this require of me? Do I think the person inviting is going to hold me well?</li>
<li><strong>Accessibility.</strong> Will my basic requirements for participation be accommodated? Language, assistive technology, unfamiliar jargon, etc. Will it be possible for me to engage?</li>
</ul>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The tool has a built-in function to <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing//en/user_manual/groups/membership/">invite users</a> by email or by sending them a special link. Users can also request to join your group if your settings allow.</li>
<li>The invitation tools built into the software are very basic, and getting an unexpected login request for new software without context isn't very inviting, so group creators often introduce people to the idea of Loomio through a separate process.</li>
<li>Many aspects of Loomio are already designed to create a safe and respectful space users would want to enter — such as thoughtful <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing//en/user_manual/groups/starting_a_group/#privacy">privacy options</a>.</li>
<li>The design of the software itself is meant to be friendly, simple, and professional, hopefully putting out a trustworthy vibe.</li>
<li>Loomio has accessibility features, for people who use assistive technology like screen readers, and translation features for people who speak different languages. Emphasising these aspects in an invitation can make some people feel more welcome.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="arrival"><a class="header" href="#arrival">Arrival</a></h2>
<p>The moment of arrival is the “first impression” of an engagement, and sets the trajectory from there on in. The person has accepted an invitation and decided to step in. They are open and expectant, and the impression they get will make a big impact on their experience.</p>
<h3 id="welcoming"><a class="header" href="#welcoming">Welcoming</a></h3>
<p>To enable openness to engagement, participation, and receptivity, a person has to feel welcome. They need their existence acknowledged, and to feel a sense of hospitality.</p>
<h3 id="settling"><a class="header" href="#settling">Settling</a></h3>
<p>When someone enters a physical room, they want to know where to sit, where the exit is, where to go to the bathroom, and if there is coffee available. They need a basic introduction to the space and their place in it.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The group description fields and discussion context box are the main space to put a “welcome message” for people arriving into the space.</li>
<li>Take a tour of the Loomio space, tweak things to make yourself comfortable (like <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing//en/user_manual/users/email_settings/">notification settings</a> and your <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing//en/user_manual/users/user_profile/">profile photo</a>.</li>
<li>See information how you like using <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/commencing//en/user_manual/users/navigation">different thread views and options</a> like Recent, Unread, Mute, and Star. Make yourself at home.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whos-in-the-room"><a class="header" href="#whos-in-the-room">Who’s in the Room</a></h2>
<p>Introducing yourself and being introduced to others is one of the most basic and most important human social functions. From Māori <em>mihimihi</em> to British “how do you do” to Japanese business card exchanges, every culture places a lot of importance on this. It goes beyond practicalities and politeness and touches on a deep human need, which is a prerequisite for comfort, openness, and focus.</p>
<p>As a facilitator, if you don’t give people a chance to introduce themselves and find out who is around them, they will generally subvert whatever else you’re trying to point their attention at until you allow this process to occur. Consciously design introductions as a feature, and use them as an opportunity to further the overall goals of the interaction.</p>
<h3 id="check-in"><a class="header" href="#check-in">Check in</a></h3>
<p>Even among groups who already know each other well, this introduction process continues with “checking in” – where everyone has a chance to speak at the beginning of a meeting (often to a question of &quot;what is on top for you&quot;, &quot;how are you&quot;, or &quot;is there anything preventing you from being present&quot;) and other good practices for team cohesion. People have a multitude of identities, which change based on the context. People answer and re-answer “who am I for this moment” all the time, and that is what allows them to orient around one another.</p>
<p>People's expression does not occur in a vaccuum, but in the context of who they are. A multi-faceted view of someone’s identity is an essential aspect of interpreting their contributions.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We start many of our meetings with everyone “checking in” before we get to the agenda. These check-ins are focused not on your work tasks, but on how you’re doing as a human being. If you’re going through a rough patch at home, or you’re sick, or you have exciting positive news, understanding your state of mind will help the entire group have the right context to interpret how you’re communicating. — Richard Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Create a thread called &quot;Introduce yourself&quot; or &quot;Check in&quot;. It provides a useful first <em>call to action</em> everyone coming in will understand.</li>
<li>For “request to join” groups, we have a function that allows the requestor to introduce themselves to the coordinator, to get access to the group. Some groups have a process of re-posting this content in the intro thread to welcome people in.</li>
<li>Upload profile photos! Photos of faces are one of the most powerful ways of feeling like you know who is in the room with you online.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whos-not-in-the-room"><a class="header" href="#whos-not-in-the-room">Who’s NOT in the Room</a></h2>
<p>Diversity is critical for quality group decision making. The “wisdom of the crowd effect” (collective intelligence) only works by combining a variety of viewpoints. Outcomes of collaboration processes depend heavily on which voices are, and are not, represented. It’s impossible to have perfect representative inclusion, but you need to take into account who might be missing.</p>
<p>It’s extremely common for people to have blind spots around privilege. Humans are not great at intuiting bias, and are a lot better at noticing the presence of something, rather than the absence. Our minds trick us. For example, when women and men are deliberately given an equal amount of talking time there is often a perception that women are getting more than their fair share, due to different ideas about how much they “should” talk (<a href="https://www.quora.com/Do-women-tend-to-talk-more-than-men">more details</a>). It can be necessary to actually measure or count to get an accurate picture, instead of relying on intuition.</p>
<p>Someone who does not have particular accessibility needs may not even notice that a venue isn’t wheelchair accessible, a document isn’t formatted for screen readers, or a situation is excluding someone with hearing loss. But the people with those challenges will notice. Someone without kids might not consider that a 7PM meeting time won't work for parents. These, and a thousand other practical, social, and cultural elements, could block someone from <em>being in the room</em>.</p>
<p>It’s especially important to think about who is not in room when trying to solve problems for others: build with, not for; talk with people, not about them. If the people you are trying to serve are not in the room, it’s very unlikely you’ll have all the input you need to be effective. This is just as much about effectiveness for business outcomes as about social justice; it’s almost always better to design collaboration <em>with</em> the users or stakeholders.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Collaborating online can allow for whole other levels of inclusion. Instead of thinking about a “digital divide”, think about the “digital bridge” — how technology can include people who cannot attend in-person meetings or participate at a specific time, and enable whole new possibilities like multi-lingual discussions.</li>
<li>Loomio makes it very clear who is invited to a group and who has participated in a discussion, giving important information for thinking about inclusion. If people are missing, you can see that.</li>
<li>If inclusive decision making and diversity of thinking are important to you, periodically ask yourself, “Who’s not in the room? Why?”</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture-protocol-expectations"><a class="header" href="#culture-protocol-expectations">Culture, Protocol, Expectations</a></h2>
<p>Culture can be quite a nebulous concept, and operates at multiple levels. The culture of the wider society has a big influence, but you can think of every group, and every session or discussion, as having a culture of its own.</p>
<p>How do we roll? How do we talk to one another? What is and is not ok here? What are the rules of the game, of how we interact?</p>
<p>The process of confronting cultural questions can be a powerful moment of self-awareness for a group. Not confronting them can harm ability to meet goals, or sometimes tear a group apart completely.</p>
<p>Culture, protocol, and expectations can be implicit or explicit, and by nature intersect in complex ways with power dynamics and social capital. It’s a challenging balance to keep things loose enough to allow emergence, evolution, creativity, and freedom, while being explicit enough about bottom lines and boundaries to ensure safety.</p>
<p>Facilitators often guide the group to live up to the culture it has set, follow the protocols it has agreed, and hold expectations to account. If a facilitator is tasked with this role, they need to be backed by a certain level of explicitness about those agreements, and a certain mandate. Otherwise, it can get messy.</p>
<p>People often want to leave things to “common sense” and avoid agreeing a code of conduct or explicit protocols. However, this can disproportionately affect the most vulnerable members of the group, since they will feel the negative impacts of bad behavior or culture first and strongest, and are least empowered to counteract it themselves. It's the responsibility of the more privileged or influential members of the group to think through these questions carefully.</p>
<p>Like a legal contract, you hope you never have to enforce a code of conduct, but if you need it you’re very glad it’s there. You want to agree <em>before</em> it becomes necessary. In order for a facilitator or any member of the group to effectively stand up and say, “that’s not OK here”, you need to have already invested in culture-building and expectation-setting.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Because Loomio is usually used as a space for constructive deliberation among groups with a specific purpose and set of members, for the most part people engage in good faith and behave respectfully.</li>
<li>Loomio is designed specifically to give voice to the individual, and let them communicate their needs and concerns. Even if a majority doesn’t see a problem, a single person can raise it and be heard.</li>
<li>Communicating online enables a certain level of physical safety, because people are not face to face.</li>
<li>Some groups already use the group description field to note a code of conduct or expectations for behavior. Others have collectively agreed a set of expectations that govern participation.</li>
<li>Many groups use Loomio itself to decide their group protocols, such as how to engage, what is allowed, what a decision means and what makes it valid, etc.</li>
<li>Some core protocol issues are answered simply by using Loomio: Who is allowed here? How do we communicate?</li>
<li>One of the most basic decisions Loomio users all encounter is about decision-making protocol — Consensus? Majority? Quorum? Unanimity? Bringing the question of decision-making protocol to the fore can be a very productive step in cultural development.</li>
</ul>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="underway"><a class="header" href="#underway">Underway</a></h1>
<p><img src="guides/facilitators_guide/underway/cover.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="where-are-we-on-the-map"><a class="header" href="#where-are-we-on-the-map">Where are we on the Map?</a></h2>
<p>People feel more confident and better held if they can orient themselves on a timeline or agenda. They want to know what they’re doing now, what’s coming up, and to be reminded of what they’ve already done. Understanding the overall shape of the process helps people understand how to contribute effectively.</p>
<p>For example if they can see there’s a Q&amp;A section later, they'll be more willing to hold their questions during a presentation. If it’s clear that there’s a divergent phase and then a convergent phase, people will hold back from jumping to solutions too soon. People need to know what kind of input they are being asked for, and when.</p>
<p>Mapping the process well enough to communicate it also challenges facilitators to fully think through the journey, and helps them make sure each part of the process has a purpose that builds a cohesive whole. A well-facilitated experience follows a logical progression.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>A Loomio decision already follows a basic logical progression (which is why it works): Gather (open/invite), Discuss (divergent), Propose (convergent), Decide and Act (conclude).</li>
<li>Many Loomio users are employing the tool as part of explicitly mapped experiences, such as a multi-stage consultation process.</li>
<li>We offer some tools of facilitators to help “reveal the map” to users, such as the group description field, and proposal deadlines. These can be proactively leveraged to increase context for participants.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-art-of-noticing"><a class="header" href="#the-art-of-noticing">The Art of Noticing</a></h2>
<p>Noticing is probably the most critical facilitation skill of all. The facilitator uses noticing to figure out what interventions or responses are needed, how to invite the right contributions, and to help the group notice itself. The value of facilitation is having someone paying attention and acting on what they notice, while others may be focused on specific content or their own agendas.</p>
<p>Effective noticing is a combination of good informational inputs, and sensitivity and skill to interpret them. Many facilitators talk about “reading” a room: emotional reactions, tensions,  power dynamics. Facilitators need effective information signalling systems.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Many current features assist with noticing — the biggest one is probably watching how the pie is shaping up in a proposal.</li>
<li>The software notices some things: who has and has not yet participated, what topics are being raised, who has and has not accepted their group invitation, etc.</li>
<li>On Loomio, a single facilitator can read across dozens of discussions at the same time, see clearly what’s being shared, and act accordingly.</li>
<li>Talking online can make the implicit explicit, and therefore easier to notice.</li>
<li>Communicating in writing can be very good for naming what’s being noticed and why a certain action is being taken in response. For example, you can quote someone’s exact words and reflect back what’s revealed by them. Or you can do the same thing at the level of a whole discussion, picking out a range of quotes and noticing themes or emerging conflicts.</li>
<li>Noticing is much easier when you slow things down, which is one of Loomio’s great advantages — asynchronous communication you can read at any pace. It also makes it possible to notice across time, referring directly to past discussions.</li>
<li>Because you can have simultaneous discussions, it's possible to have a layer of “meta” discussion (aka “blue hat”, aka discussion about the discussion) at the same time as progressing the main discussions. So you can collectively have a space to practice noticing without slowing down the process.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="hearing-diverse-voices"><a class="header" href="#hearing-diverse-voices">Hearing Diverse Voices</a></h2>
<p>In our society, multiple layers of history, power dynamics, culture, and psychology conspire to amplify certain voices and suppress others. This plays out at every level of experience, from our innermost subconscious beliefs to our political system and laws.</p>
<p>But the best ideas do not always come from the loudest voices, and the role of facilitation is to counteract these biases. It’s important to be aware of the dynamics we are collectively grappling with if our goals are social justice, group effectiveness, and high quality decision making.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="border-radius: 100%; float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; max-width: 96px; " src="guides/facilitators_guide/underway/../rich_200.png"> If you want to innovate, you have to make space for different points of view — luckily, this is also what you need to do if you want a team where everyone is empowered. All kinds of cultural and technical factors conspire to privilege some voices at the expense of others. There are many practices you can implement to systematically challenge that bias, but just being aware of it is a good starting point. — Richard Bartlett</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Our lived human experience is to inhabit a singular consciousness, so humans tend to forget that others experience the world differently. Even within a seemingly homogenous group, there is incredible diversity — perspectives, pace, preferences. Internalising this truth — that others are different from myself — is a central personal growth challenge.</p>
<p>There is no such thing as one size fits all. Any mode of interacting enhances some voices and quiets others, or emphasises different tendencies within an individual. So, it’s necessary to employ a range of approaches to invite the best from multiple diverse voices.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><img style="border-radius: 100%; float: right; margin-left: 0.5em; max-width: 96px; " src="guides/facilitators_guide/underway/../silvia_200.png"> Check you’re catering to different learning styles. One simple way to check is with the Head, Heart, Hands metaphor. People who learn with their Head need facts and detailed information. A Heart learner thrives off stories. They need an emotional connection to the work. Learning with the Hands is all about doing stuff and getting active. — Silvia Zuur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>One of the best approaches to bringing out and weaving together diverse voices is to invite diverse modes of interaction, which will serve different needs and preferences, and level the communication playing field.</p>
<p>Some classic design building blocks to address communication diversity in collaborative communication:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Group size</strong> — individual reflection, pairs, small group, large group, one-to-one, one-to-many, many-to-many.</li>
<li><strong>Medium of expression</strong> — writing, drawing, video, singing, dance, flowcharts, equations, symbols, stories, tears, laughter, debate, etc.</li>
<li><strong>Discussion protocols</strong> — rounds (hear from each person once before moving on), rate limiting (you can only speak again after two others have spoken), talking stick (only speak when you have the stick — no interrupting), time-limited contributions (you can talk for 1 minute only), time-unlimited contributions (you can hold the floor indefinitely and everyone will deeply listen), tracking contributions (how much have women vs men spoken, etc), holding periods of silence between speakers (for processing and reflection).</li>
<li><strong>Embrace silence</strong> <em>Silence is only awkward if you let it be awkward. Silence is a chance for people to think. — Silvia Zuur</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The design of Loomio has always been about “hearing all voices”, including people who aren’t able to be there in person, are quieter, are busy, etc.</li>
<li>In text, every voice is more or less the same “volume” and “speed”. Written asynchronous communication offers a kind of leveling of the field.</li>
<li>The proposal feature is essentially a “round”, assisting groups to facilitate each individual person having their say (if they want to) on an equal basis.</li>
<li>Loomio enables multi-media (links, videos, images, diagrams, supporting evidence), which serve various communication styles.</li>
<li>Loomio itself is pretty basic, but with active facilitation and group maturity, it is possible to employ discussion protocols “manually” using cultural norms or agreed rules (eg, a discussion where everyone only posts once until everyone else has participated).</li>
<li>Loomio provides flexible tools for small and large group interaction, using parent groups and subgroups. Some large consultation processes have involved multiple smaller groups which are then synthesised into a larger outcome.</li>
<li>People who want time for individual reflection can take time out and process their thoughts, and then come back and share a longer comment or link to a document. This is a “self-selecting” example of creating interplay between individual and group communication.</li>
<li>Loomio accessibility features and multi-lingual translations make it possible for people with very different needs to participate as equals in one discussion. This is a key example of how technology can enable equitable participation in a way that’s nearly impossible in person.</li>
<li>If someone is contributing more than their share (talking too much), it’s technically possible to just scroll on by (whereas in person this behaviour can totally dominate the interaction). However, people posting “walls of text” can still be detrimental to a balanced Loomio discussion.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="counter-cognitive-bias"><a class="header" href="#counter-cognitive-bias">Counter Cognitive Bias</a></h2>
<p>Human brains have evolved over millions of years to balance quick, efficient “good enough” thinking with slow, expensive, deep analysis. This allows us to use instincts, heuristics, and generalisations as cheap and fast solutions most of the time, and to engage deep analysis when needed.</p>
<p>But sometimes we get it wrong. In fact, there are well-known “bugs” in the human cognition program, which can keep people from making the best decisions. This is further complicated in group situations. We need to be aware of these dynamics.</p>
<p>There is a huge <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_cognitive_biases">range of cognitive biases</a> (this list is really worth a read), all of which have potential impacts on decision making and collaboration. Facilitation can be an important tool to deal with them, to raise awareness of their existence, encourage proactive choices about them. For example, asking when is it more important to move quickly and when is it more important to be accurate.</p>
<p>One powerful tool to counter cognitive bias and increase quality of decisions is structured processes and communication. The challenge of following a process instead of the “path of least resistance” can help highlight thinking errors and bias. Facilitators sometimes push for things that feel challenging or trigger resistance, precisely because brains are being asked to step out of familiar patterns. Discipline in this area can help groups achieve their deeper goals, which can be worth some temporary discomfort.</p>
<p>Some examples of processes that can help mitigate cognitive bias:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.debonoforschools.com/asp/six_hats.asp">De Bono’s Hats</a>: different colored hats participants can wear (metaphorically) to step outside their own opinions and try on different modes of thinking.</li>
<li>Checklists: thinking “ruts” can cause us to miss even obvious things (especially in areas we're very familiar with), so a checklist can weed out errors.</li>
<li>The Five Why’s: only asking why once or twice can mislead you into thinking you’ve reached the conclusion before you get to the root level of the issue. Asking five times tends to get to the bottom of it.</li>
<li>Mental models: exercises like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SWOT_analysis">SWOT analysis</a>, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Business_Model_Canvas">business model canvas</a>, or any number of countless other structured information gathering exercises can guide you to cleaner analysis and reveal assumptions.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Diverse information and inputs can disrupt assumptions or bias. This is built into Loomio’s basic design: by enabling more voices to contribute to a discussion on a more equitable basis, you have a chance to escape “groupthink”.</li>
<li>Loomio gives participants the ability to dissent constructively. Safe and valued dissent is essential for a culture of critical thinking.</li>
<li>Communicating asynchronously in writing slows conversation down and lets it be more carefully considered, giving people a chance to think more carefully and avoid cognitive errors.</li>
<li>Loomio invites people into a semi-structured process that leads to more considered decision making. Loomio can be used for a huge range of different processes, but simply having <em>some</em> structure in a discussion enables other possibilities.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="balancing-divergent--convergent"><a class="header" href="#balancing-divergent--convergent">Balancing Divergent &amp; Convergent</a></h2>
<p>The “diamond” of divergence and convergence is a conversational shape. It expands outward at first — opening up space for ideas, information, and different perspectives — then begins to come to a point. The right timing for this shift is key for effective facilitation of action-oriented, productive, collaborative discussions.</p>
<p><img src="guides/facilitators_guide/underway/../collaboration-process.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If divergence is missed out or cut off too early, there will be a lack of information to work with, people may not feel heard, and great ideas will be left unsaid. If convergence is missed out or left too late, discussion can continue indefinitely without reaching an actionable conclusion, burning participants energy and failing to achieve results.</p>
<p>Each sub-phase of the larger process also requires awareness of the right timing and intervention. Divergence consists of introduction, clarification, ideation. Convergence consists of analysis, conclusion, commitment. Some discussions succeed with only a vague nod toward the diamond, while others are served by a meticulous breakdown of each phase and sub-phase.</p>
<p>Within a group, different individuals will usually tend to prefer one mode or the other, and the group as a whole will have collective tendencies. Imbalance looks like too much blue sky thinking, or jumping to solutions. Facilitation can help each person and the group as a whole spend the right amount of energy on the different modes.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The core Loomio process does an excellent job of guiding groups to touch on each phase of the process, with the discussion being divergent and proposals being convergent. Awareness of the diamond was a big inspiration for the original design of the Loomio process.</li>
<li>Loomio helps groups to use the diamond in dynamic ways, such as when an attempt to converge (a proposal) ends up becoming a deeper level of divergence (disagreement), revealing or clarifying information to support an even better convergence (iterated proposal).</li>
<li>Some of Loomio’s basic features go a long way toward supporting each mode, such as notifications to group members when a new discussion is starting (prompting divergent contribution), and deadlines on proposals (prompting participation in convergence).</li>
<li>Loomio users are already able to use the existing feature set to facilitate convergence — namely starting a proposal. Good use of proposals is one of the most obvious symptoms of an effective Loomio group, and simply advising users to start more proposals unblocks many groups who are having issues.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="working-with-scope"><a class="header" href="#working-with-scope">Working with Scope</a></h2>
<p>Successful collaboration often depends on biting off the right size pieces in the right order.</p>
<p>You can apply a “project management” mindset to facilitation, designing for questions like:</p>
<ul>
<li>What are the dependencies (what’s the critical path, which things need to be done first to enable other things)?</li>
<li>What are the most important bits to focus on? What can be left out?</li>
<li>What is an achievable scope to tackle at a given time to get to a useful place with the time, energy, and information available?</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s important not to try to “boil the ocean”, and instead break things down into manageable chunks. You can build toward a bigger outcome in a series of smaller pieces. It’s often better to achieve something small but useful, than to fail to reach any conclusions. It’s also possible to get too bogged down in details and fail to hit the bigger issues.</p>
<p>In a collaboration, no one knows exactly what will emerge, so scope must evolve with the discussion. Whether branching out at a given moment is a distraction or an evolution is a judgement call. Too much rigidity and too much flexibility can both be damaging. Often times it’s not about whether something is relevant or not, but a question of sequence and timing in terms of what will be most constructive.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>If you plan a session with multiple, interlinked parts – each one building on the other, and all leading to a life-changing, mind-exploding conclusion – and you can pull it off, then that’s amazing. But more often than not, a complicated session will go over-time and may not hit the participant’s wants and needs. - Silvia Zuur</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="a-series-of-small-yess"><a class="header" href="#a-series-of-small-yess">A series of small yes's</a></h2>
<p>Lumping too many conversations together simply creates confusion. Frustrated groups are often helped by breaking things down. If an issue seems hopeless, complex or conflicted, it can be possible to separate out individual questions and reach consensus on them, starting with the easiest things to agree. Then when it comes to points of disagreement, you can pare it down to only the crux of the issues and work on them in a focused way.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Topic-based discussion threads are a powerful tool for effective scope — even more than face-to-face conversation, Loomio discussions can be usefully delineated to encourage focus on a specific question, while other aspects can be addressed simultaneously in other threads.</li>
<li>We often see users making facilitation interventions like “That’s out of the scope of this topic, but why don’t you start a new discussion about it?”</li>
<li>The act of creating a Loomio group helps define who are we and what are we here to discuss. This helps participants manage scope.</li>
<li>The sequential proposals design of Loomio is very good for a “series of small yess's” approach — you can build small agreements while maintaining context in a single discussion thread, and build on the history of previous proposals.</li>
<li>Asynchronous online communication can allow some people to go way out of scope without holding up others. They can simply start a new discussion or subgroup and go as deep and long as they want, while the main scope of the group is maintained.</li>
<li>The discussion context box and group description are spaces to define the scope of a conversation or group, respectively.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="pacing--timing"><a class="header" href="#pacing--timing">Pacing &amp; Timing</a></h2>
<p>A productive conversation has a rhythm. The right beat comes from a complex combination of factors and often feels intuitive, like a musician improvising. When is the moment to go deeper, or pull back? When is it right to bring in new information, or further delve into what’s already on the table? This is pacing.</p>
<p>Different participants will have different needs and preferences — some will need reigning in, while others need pulling along. The right pace emerges when a creative tension between digging deeper and moving forward is found. When it’s off, people will feel frustrated — either impatient or left behind.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Because it’s asynchronous, people can read and respond at their own pace on Loomio, allowing a natural pace to emerge.</li>
<li>It’s possible to scroll right past people moving slowly and push for forward momentum, and simultaneously possible to continue digging into something slowly while others press forward. This is not possible in synchronous communication.</li>
<li>Proposal deadlines are a pace-setting tool. Topics that need to move quickly use shorter timeframes, and longer ones can have more time. Different decisions can go at different speeds.</li>
<li>It’s easy to modulate your own pace of engagement. If a conversation is moving too fast or slowly for you, you can drop your input and step back, and then return later when a proposal is raised.</li>
<li>It’s interesting to note how a “fast” decision on Loomio is 1 or 2 days, while a “fast” decision in person is more like 5 minutes. And yet, Loomio does not seem “slow”, the way taking 2 days to reach a decision in person would. Loomio runs decisions in parallel to other ongoing work, and it's much more efficient gathering everyone’s input on Loomio over 2 days versus having to schedule an in-person meeting.</li>
<li>Facilitation on Loomio could be likened to “bullet time” (when Neo can stop time and just walk around a bullet in the Matrix) — you can walk through a living conversation frame by frame. It’s like a superpower.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="managing-the-attention-economy"><a class="header" href="#managing-the-attention-economy">Managing the Attention Economy</a></h2>
<p>A facilitator is a curator of attention. The information available can be literally infinite. It becomes critical to filter it in order to avoid becoming overwhelmed. Managing the attention economy means balancing importance against time and capacity.</p>
<p>Facilitation can help the group agree what the purpose and scope of a given discussion or process is, so they can have a rubric for prioritising attention. Limiting distractions and steering the conversation back on track are common interventions.</p>
<p>Another important way facilitators work with attention is to insist on the group holding it long enough. When things get challenging, unclear, or uncomfortable, people to want to give up too soon, jump to another topic, or look away. A facilitator can help the group see things through, in service of their collective goals.</p>
<p>Structured processes and information sorting exercises are important facilitation tools in this area. Some examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Time-boxing</strong> — specifying a period of brainstorming, or conversation on a given topic.</li>
<li><strong>Agenda prioritisation</strong> — listing everything people want to talk about and then picking to top items to focus on, before jumping into content.</li>
<li><strong>Post-it cloud</strong> — generating a bunch of ideas or questions and grouping them thematically and then condensing them into topics.</li>
<li><strong>Parking lot</strong> — a space to stick ideas or questions that come up that are not immediately relevant, to be addressed later.</li>
<li><strong>What does success look like??</strong> Defining success criteria and keeping the group focused on it until those criteria are achieved.</li>
</ul>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>One of the most important attention management features in Loomio is topic-based discussion threading. There’s a reason why this format was one of the first to emerge in online communication decades ago, and continues to be used widely today: it’s a highly effective way to sort attention. Most Loomio users intuitively understand how to stay on topic when it’s listed in big letters at the top of the page.</li>
<li>Activity in Loomio is the currency of its attention economy, and everything that generates a notification spends that currency. The software has opinions about what should be considered “salient” activity that generates notifications (for example, comments, votes, and outcomes are, while a “like” on a comment is not), developed based on user feedback.</li>
<li>Users can exercise a lot of customised control over their Loomio attention economy through notification settings. Helping users set these preferences is an important tool to wisely using the attention economy of the group.</li>
<li>Subgroups can be a powerful tool to help people moderate their attention economy. If only some people need to pay attention, you can split it out.</li>
<li>The intentional but somewhat unpopular design decision to disallow concurrent proposals in Loomio is about the flow of attention — holding a group’s “feet to the fire” to fully process a proposal before moving on.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Many designers of information systems incorrectly represented their design problem as information scarcity rather than attention scarcity, and as a result they built systems that excelled at providing more and more information to people, when what was really needed were systems that excelled at filtering out unimportant or irrelevant information. — <strong><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy">Wikipedia</a></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="facilitation-interventions"><a class="header" href="#facilitation-interventions">Facilitation Interventions</a></h2>
<p>There are as many facilitation techniques as there are facilitators in the world, and entire libraries of books have been written on the topic. It’s not possible to provide a comprehensive list of interventions.</p>
<p>However, it might be useful to consider two categories of interventions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Supportive interventions</strong>: inviting contribution, going deeper, drawing out, coaxing, nurturing, protecting, creating space.</li>
<li><strong>Assertive interventions</strong>: pulling back, shutting down, drawing lines, interrupting, challenging, steering on course, excluding bad behaviour.</li>
</ol>
<p>Almost all interventions in face-to-face facilitation can be reimagined and employed in the online space.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Singling people out for a contribution will just make them feel like the stupid kid in class who doesn’t know the answer. Instead, a general invite to people who haven’t spoken yet to contribute tells the regular contributors to stay quiet, and gives quieter people the opportunity to step forward. — Silvia Zuur</p>
</blockquote>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Intervention tools in Loomio include comments, @mentions, adding/removing users, and starting/deleting discussions. These can be employed for various forms of supportive and assertive interventions.</li>
<li>The most commonly used intervention is the comment — simply talking to the group and inviting or trying to reduce certain behaviour.</li>
<li><a href="guides/facilitators_guide/underway//en/user_manual/groups/settings/#permissions">Participation permissions</a> offer relatively blunt but effective tools to moderate users, such as allowing or disallowing posting discussions or proposals.</li>
<li>Loomio offers some trust-based features that other tools lack, such as the default ability for all participants to edit discussion contexts (even if it was posted originally by another user). These are inspired by things like Wikipedia and open source software development.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="outcomes--next-steps"><a class="header" href="#outcomes--next-steps">Outcomes &amp; Next Steps</a></h2>
<p>Confirming the outcome can be critical to feel like the goals of a collaborative discussion have been achieved. A facilitator can pull together what’s been decided and reflect it back, to help the group walk away with the answers to some key questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>What did we do?</li>
<li>What does it mean?</li>
<li>What will happen now?</li>
<li>What is my responsibility?</li>
<li>What will be different because we went through this experience?</li>
</ul>
<p>Sometimes the answers to these questions are very concrete, such as action points, while other times they are more abstract, such as deepening shared understanding.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="guides/facilitators_guide/concluding//en/user_manual/polls/outcomes">Outcomes</a> are a very important tool. A proposal ending is not quite the end: there’s a need to sum up conclusively. That's what the outcome feature is for.</li>
<li>Many Loomio discussions come to a natural end without even using proposals or publishing outcomes. These discussions still provide a lot of value, and it can be helpful to update the context box with an outcome summary for later reference.</li>
<li>If specific people have action points, you can @mention their names and they will be notified.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="reporting--harvesting"><a class="header" href="#reporting--harvesting">Reporting &amp; Harvesting</a></h2>
<p>To understand the meaning of an experience, you have to inquire into how it fits into the bigger context. What was this moment, in the bigger rhythm of our progress? What form will our understanding from this experience take — a story, a report, a change, a call to action?</p>
<p>The experience happens in the moment, but its impact often comes from putting handles on it, giving it a name, and being able to use it and refer to it. Otherwise you risk forgetting, leaving people out who weren't there, or having to repeat it later. Productive collaboration is often helped by tangible documentation or reporting.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio is self-documenting — notes write themselves as an integrated part of the process. This creates a gold-mine of archival content for groups, without any extra effort.</li>
<li>We have some features to support harvesting and archiving: the search function, the “previous decisions” list, and the print discussion option.</li>
<li>Premium plans offer the option to export all your group's Loomio data.</li>
<li>Many groups use Loomio to integrate content from various channels. For example, posting a meeting announcement and building the agenda on Loomio, having the meeting in person, posting the notes back on Loomio, and making related decisions in the same thread. This expands the “self-harvesting” ability of Loomio beyond the online space.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="turning-discussion-into-action"><a class="header" href="#turning-discussion-into-action">Turning Discussion into Action</a></h2>
<p>There comes a moment when you have to re-engage with the reality outside the room. Occasionally, the need is simply to work with ideas and feelings, without worrying about implementation. But usually a group will not reach its goals without applying its conclusions to real-world action. This transition is part of the total facilitated experience.</p>
<p>It’s at this point that a collaborative process intersects with other organizational systems, and the facilitator has to help figure out how it will work. These other systems might include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Power</strong> — Who actually makes decisions? What has to happen for ideas to turn into reality here?</li>
<li><strong>Management</strong> — How does this fit into other priorities? What dependencies might exist?</li>
<li><strong>Delegation</strong> — Who will take responsibility for next steps? Will they be held accountable?</li>
<li><strong>Communication</strong> — How will this process or discussion be relayed to others? What do they need to know?</li>
<li><strong>Administration</strong> — How will information from one system be input into another, such as a task tracking or communications tool? Where will information be stored?</li>
</ul>
<p>If there are any blocks around these issues, it can be damaging to leave this realisation until the moment of conclusion. For example, if the participants don’t actually have the power to make a change they have decided, they will feel defeated.Think ahead toward confronting reality when setting up the process, and scope the collaboration accordingly.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>You can @mention the names of people who will take actions out of a decision.</li>
<li>Many users accomplish integrating Loomio content into other organizational systems through other channels like reviewing Loomio decisions in regular offline meetings, or transferring outcomes to their task tracking process.</li>
<li>Making an explicit decision naturally leads people to ask, “OK, but how are we going to take this forward?”</li>
<li>Forming a Loomio group often surfaces important questions like, “Who needs to participate here to turn these decisions into action?” If you're missing key stakeholders, leaders, or administrators, you'll get stuck.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="it-aint-over-til-its-over"><a class="header" href="#it-aint-over-til-its-over">It Ain’t Over Til It’s Over</a></h2>
<p>Ending well is important. There’s a ritual to closing a process, and if it’s missed people will feel unsettled. Sometimes the end is determined by running out of time, and sometimes it’s when certain goals are achieved. Recognize implicit and explicit cues indicating if the individuals, and the group as a whole, can feel completion of a process or phase.</p>
<p>Participants often look to the leader or facilitator for confirmation of when it’s actually over, and it usually pays to be explicit. Sometimes the signal is a clear statement that the session is wrapping up, a recap of decisions or next steps, and bidding everyone goodbye. Other times groups have established practices like a check-out. Letting a session vaguely trail off will leave a bad taste.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The clearest indication of conclusion on Loomio is publishing a decision outcome.</li>
<li>Some groups use the <a href="guides/facilitators_guide/concluding//en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin#close-thread">close thread</a> feature to archive discussions and reduce clutter.</li>
<li>Deactivating a group is the strongest possible “closure” move. No one can say anything else after that.</li>
<li>Since Loomio groups can remain while group activity goes up and down, it can be useful to recognize milestones like the conclusion of a particular phase, even if the group will reactivate in the future.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="continuous-improvement"><a class="header" href="#continuous-improvement">Continuous Improvement</a></h2>
<p>No matter how amazing a group or facilitator is, they can always improve. If they incrementally head in a good direction they will get to a better place. Incremental improvement requires an effective protocol for meta-conversation (talking about how you collaborate). With it, anything is possible. Without it, you stagnate.</p>
<p>There are many approaches to continuous improvement, but they all create space for reflection and feedback, and a way to make changes in response. For teams that work together on an ongoing basis, they might employ a methodology like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scrum_(software_development)" target="_blank">scrum</a>, including retrospectives and regular process improvements. For a one-off session, a facilitator might simply follow up with a request for feedback.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>People use Loomio itself to talk about how they use Loomio. It provides an obvious platform to “talk about the talking”.</li>
<li>The process of joining Loomio causes groups to reflect on many aspects of their collaboration and decision-making process, which creates the opportunity to improve.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="distributed-facilitation--self-facilitation"><a class="header" href="#distributed-facilitation--self-facilitation">Distributed Facilitation / Self-facilitation</a></h2>
<p>As a group becomes more experienced, more individuals build capacity for facilitation. Facilitation can cease to be a role held by a specific person, and become more of a function that can be distributed. Anyone can take acts of facilitation, and a dance of give and take, leading and following, can emerge among participants. For groups with aspirations toward shared leadership and non-hierarchy, this is a very important thing to encourage.</p>
<p>People who are less used to taking acts of facilitation can be supported with education, invitations, and suggestions of first steps. Some examples of acts of facilitation almost anyone can be encouraged to try:</p>
<ul>
<li>reflecting back what you’re hearing or summarising</li>
<li>inviting others to contribute</li>
<li>asking questions to enhance collective understanding</li>
<li>noticing who is and is not participating</li>
<li>appreciating contributions explicitly</li>
</ul>

</blockquote>
<p>Distributed facilitation can work beautifully, but it can also cause people to step all over each other. At first, it’s awkward as people learn the dance. It’s important to differentiate between distributed facilitation (peers helping the collective), “facipulation” (manipulating the group toward your own agenda), and backseat facilitation (taking acts of facilitation when you do not have the mandate).</p>
<p>Consciously decide when peer facilitation is a good choice, and when a specific facilitator is called for. In certain situations, such as a high-conflict discussion where a specified neutral party is needed, or there is a lack of trust, distributed facilitation might not work.</p>

<h2 id="translating-this-into-loomio"><a class="header" href="#translating-this-into-loomio">Translating this into Loomio</a></h2>
<ul>
<li>The online space is uniquely suited to distributed facilitation. Different people can come along at different points depending on what they notice and their skill set.</li>
<li>An online discussion is by default a distributed collaboration among peers. Any other setup requires explicit design. This is the opposite of offline spaces where the default is that someone called a meeting and distributing the role requires proactivity.</li>
<li>Loomio is designed with a group of equals in mind. In many ways, a distributed facilitation approach is the best fit for the tool.</li>
<li>Current Loomio users do peer facilitation all the time, whether they realize that’s what they are doing or not. Simple things like suggesting someone raise a proposal, tagging people, summarising the process so far, etc, are all acts of facilitation.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="the-art-of-being-facilitated"><a class="header" href="#the-art-of-being-facilitated">The Art of Being Facilitated</a></h2>
<p>Like the skill of being the follow in a ballroom dance pair, being facilitated is an art itself. People with experience facilitating themselves, or who have participated in a lot of well-facilitated processes, will receive facilitation differently than those who haven't.</p>
<p>On the positive side, skillful receptivity to facilitation is a capacoty that can be grown, and it can have a big impact on group success. This ranges from things as simple as showing up on time, to following instructions, to being willing to try a new style of thinking or communicating. Sometimes people have a good experience and they don’t quite know why — pointing out that facilitation is the reason for the smoothness or depth can help them understand what it is they valued about the process.</p>
<p>On the negative side, people who can’t or won’t be facilitated can be detrimental to group collaboration. No matter how skilled a facilitator is, if they encounter a certain level of resistance they won’t be able to do their job. Common problems include dominating the discussion, playing devil’s advocate, disrupting the process, disrespecting the facilitator or participants, or being disengaged. At some level individuals must take responsibility for their willingness to be facilitated.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>With a little practice, most users quickly upskill on being responsive to acts of facilitation on Loomio, such as replying when @mentioned.</li>
<li>Taking acts of facilitation on Loomio helps people become more responsive to facilitation themselves.</li>
<li>Because everything is archived, users can see past acts of facilitation “frozen in time”, gaining the benefits of observing them without having been there.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="culture-change"><a class="header" href="#culture-change">Culture Change</a></h2>
<p>A collaborative, participatory culture is something that emerges over time, with lots of practice and trial and error. Understanding, valuing, and inviting facilitation can play a pivotal role in this cultural emergence. Facilitation can evolve from a role, to a function, to a mindset. A truly collaborative culture is one where everyone is facilitating everyone in myriad different ways.</p>
<p>Is the company party participatory? Does the office potluck just happen like magic? Are ideas able to emerge from anywhere, evolve through many brains and hands, and get implemented in a way better than anyone first imagined?</p>
<p>Deep culture change is when the culture of collaboration starts to leak out of specific “collaboration” spaces and shows up in every aspect of the organization. Collaboration is not about post-it notes and check-ins, but the very timbre of organizational life.</p>
<p>On Loomio</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://www.loomio.com/about">theory of change of Loomio</a> is that more groups practicing effective, inclusive decision making can change organizational dynamics at a global scale. This shows up in everything about how the tool is designed and <a href="http://loomio.coop">how we run as a co-op</a>. Ultimately, it’s about culture change through collaborative practice.</li>
<li>Loomio groups have experienced evolving culture through the tool. Like groups that already has a collaborative culture scale while holding onto that, or a participatory group continuing to exists instead of imploding due to challanges around inclusive decicion-making.</li>
<li>Loomio makes a certain kind of “new normal” of collaborative practice possible, through making collaborative practice more accessible and achievable.</li>

<p>You have set up a new Loomio group and believe it can help your group collaborate on projects, make decisions and get work done - but members of your group aren’t engaging!</p>
<p>We know that everyone has their favorite tools and work habits, and many people are reluctant to learn a new tool.</p>
<p>Here are some tips that may help you and your group to actively participate in discussions,  make decisions together and progress work to an outcome.</p>

</ol>
<h2 id="warm-up-your-group"><a class="header" href="#warm-up-your-group">Warm up your group</a></h2>
<p>To warm up, I suggest starting a <strong>thread</strong> with an open question that will get people posting their first <strong>comment</strong>. </p>
<p>Questions that are relevant to your group, provoke a response and are easy to answer are best.</p>
<p>Here are some examples;</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Last year was crazy!  What is one thing you learnt?</em></li>
<li><em>The work we do together is important. What should we focus on for the biggest impact?</em></li>
<li><em>What are you most excited about?</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Next, start a new <strong>thread</strong> with a document attached, or a link to an article, and invite people to comment - <em>“what do you think about this?”</em></p>
<p>Start a <strong>Check poll</strong> in the thread asking everyone to confirm they have read the document or article and left a comment in the thread..</p>
<p>If people can sign in to Loomio, read a thread, post a comment and vote in a poll, they have the basic skills needed to use Loomio :-)</p>
<p><img src="guides/warm_up_your_group.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="bring-your-work-plan-into-loomio"><a class="header" href="#bring-your-work-plan-into-loomio">Bring your work plan into Loomio</a></h2>
<p>To get work done in Loomio, you need to bring your work into Loomio.</p>
<p>As everyone begins to understand that Loomio is the place to go to find the information they need, to discuss and make decisions about their work; new work habits begin to form.</p>
<p>What are the outcomes you need to achieve? For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft and approve a strategic document</li>
<li>Plan and deliver an event</li>
<li>Seek advice and prepare a recommendation to stakeholders</li>
<li>Submit a proposal to a customer, or to seek funding</li>
</ul>
<p>Run your work program on Loomio, where everyone can find the info they need, keep up to speed on progress, contribute to discussions, participate in decisions and celebrate key milestones.</p>
<h2 id="use-a-loomio-thread-instead-of-writing-an-email"><a class="header" href="#use-a-loomio-thread-instead-of-writing-an-email">Use a Loomio thread instead of writing an email</a></h2>
<p>Next time you need to communicate with your group, instead of writing another email, start a Loomio thread!</p>
<p>Even if people have not accepted your invitation to the group, you can invite them to the thread with their email address. </p>
<p>They can reply via email and their comment will appear in the Loomio thread.  And it may help encourage them to join the group, where they can comment and leave a reaction within Loomio. </p>
<p>Here's how:</p>
<ul>
<li>Make the email subject line the title of your thread.</li>
<li>Write your email content in the thread context.</li>
<li>Invite your team to the thread with their email address or Loomio user name.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Loomio thread means that:</p>
<ul>
<li>All info about a topic is organized in one easily accessible place.</li>
<li>People can respond without generating reply/reply-all email chains that risks leaving people out.</li>
<li>You can see who has read the message and who needs a nudge.</li>
<li>You can progress actual work to an outcome, and cut down on the amount of email.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="seek-participation-through-a-proposal-or-poll"><a class="header" href="#seek-participation-through-a-proposal-or-poll">Seek participation through a Proposal or Poll</a></h2>
<p>Have a report to approve? A recommendation seeking endorsement? Or simply need acknowledgement that your team has read a document and had the opportunity to ask questions?</p>
<p>Raising a proposal tells your group that something is happening! It's a great way to progress a discussion towards an outcome and invites people into active participation - to say they approve, or not, and why...</p>
<p>Loomio's proposal and polls conform to a structured pattern where a clear question is asked, a deadline is set, people are invited to vote, a reminder is sent 24 hours before close, and a clear outcome is posted.</p>
<p>Use proposals to uncover problems, agree principles first, seek mandate, invite engagement, run a 'temperature check' and to make a decision with your team - whether an advice, consent or consensus decision.</p>
<h2 id="point-people-to-loomio-as-the-preferred-place-for-communication"><a class="header" href="#point-people-to-loomio-as-the-preferred-place-for-communication">Point people to Loomio as the preferred place for communication</a></h2>
<p>Responding to questions from the team via email, chat or phone message? </p>
<p>Start a &quot;Questions&quot; thread, where people can post their questions as comments, and anyone in the group can respond by replying to the comment.</p>
<p>Or encourage members to start their own thread with their question - someone in your group may have a great answer!</p>
<ul>
<li>It takes time to break old habits, and nudging people to communicate on Loomio helps everyone to engage, and to find info in the one place - not scattered in snippets of inaccessible email or chat conversations.</li>
<li>Shoulder-tap some members to share their question, report, work or information.</li>
<li>Encourage and acknowledge people posting with a comment or reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p>I hope this helps.  Do let us know how you get on, and tell us what works for your group! </p>

<p><em>How successful groups collaborate to achieve great outcomes.</em></p>
<p>Why do some groups succeed, while others fail? This is the underlying question group coordinators and facilitators grapple with as they seek to help people do better work together.</p>
<p>From volunteer activist groups to companies to governance boards, in our work with people around the world, time and time again we see a few key factors that all successful groups have in common. So, what sets great groups apart from the rest?</p>
<h2 id="1-successful-groups-know-their-why"><a class="header" href="#1-successful-groups-know-their-why">1. Successful groups know their WHY</a></h2>
<p>All successful groups share a common purpose that unites members in their contributions. Each member knows the WHY behind their efforts, which motivates them to bring their best selves to work.</p>

<h2 id="2-they-share-the-same-vision"><a class="header" href="#2-they-share-the-same-vision">2. They share the same vision</a></h2>
<p>High-functioning groups know exactly what they are set up to achieve and what the outcome looks like when their work is complete. They hold this vision even when they come across speedbumps on their journey.</p>

<p>Great groups are intentional in their actions. They know exactly what work they need to do, by when, and who they need to help get this work done. They use online platforms like Loomio to stay organized and project management tools to get work done. Members report regularly on steps taken towards their goals and celebrate victories and milestones along the way.</p>

<p>Like all relationships, maintaining good group dynamics requires hard work. Groups that prioritize their ties with each other tend to perform better than others.</p>
<p>Successful groups also try to involve all members in discussion. They invite diverse participation as they understand that this helps them to move through complexity.</p>
<p>They do regular check-ins to make sure that everyone is on the same page and feel heard and validated. They use tools like Loomio to make decisions and come to collective agreements together.</p>

<p><em>Tried and true practices for productive communication.</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/best_practice_types_of_discussion_threads.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>This article will guide you through <strong>five powerful ways to use threads</strong> that have been tried and tested over the years by groups around the world.</p>
<ol>
<li><a href="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/index.html#ask-a-question">Ask a question</a></li>
<li><a href="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/index.html#prepare-for-an-event-or-meeting">Prepare for an event</a></li>

</ol>
<h2 id="ask-a-question"><a class="header" href="#ask-a-question">Ask a question</a></h2>
<p><em>Brainstorm, explore, open…</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_what_rhythm.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Most productive conversations start with questions (“<a href="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads//en/guides/facilitators_guide/underway/#balancing-divergent--convergent">divergence</a>”, in our Facilitator Guide).</p>
<p>Start a new thread for each new inquiry; an inquiry can include several related questions. Use open questions to explore and get more engagement. Engage people directly by <strong>@mentioning</strong> them and asking them specifically. If you can, name any clear, shared outcome or understanding that results. As with any thread, a clear, simple title will help people find answers to engage now and reflect on down the road.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> When scheduling, use a <strong>time poll</strong> to more easily gather responses and see what times align for even the largest groups.</p>
<h2 id="prepare-for-an-event-or-meeting"><a class="header" href="#prepare-for-an-event-or-meeting">Prepare for an event (or meeting)</a></h2>
<p><em>Check in, propose, coordinate...</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_board_meeting.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Preparing for events or meetings on Loomio saves you the frustration of several different conversations and resources being scattered across several email chains. Start one thread per event; for a board meeting you might use one thread to pick a date, collaborate on agenda-setting, post minutes, record actions &amp; follow-up on actions. <strong>Edit</strong> the thread context, which always stays at the top, to let people know what kind of participation is being asked for right now. Especially if they missed the meeting… you can <strong>attach</strong> audio, link notes, or <strong>embed</strong> videos too, helping people to jump right into any ongoing conversation.</p>
<h2 id="post-ideas-or-introductions-over-time"><a class="header" href="#post-ideas-or-introductions-over-time">Post ideas or introductions over time</a></h2>
<p><em>Share, envision, benchmark…</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_workers_wall.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Threads can be <strong>'walls'</strong> or <strong>'bulletin boards'</strong> where your group posts info, news items and ideas you'd like to share with your group. Use one thread, <a href="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads//en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin/#pin-thread">pin</a> it so that it sticks around even if used infrequently, and use <strong>reactions</strong> to keep it energized, letting people know you saw what they shared or how you felt about it.</p>
<p><strong>Tips:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Organize comments to appear <strong>newest first</strong> – <a href="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads//en/user_manual/threads/navigating_threads/#oldest-or-newest-first">here’s how</a></li>
<li>If this is new for your group, write a context!</li>
<li>If your group members are new to one another, create an <strong>Introductions thread</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="take-a-document-to-completion"><a class="header" href="#take-a-document-to-completion">Take a document to completion</a></h2>
<p><em>Co-create, approve, finalize…</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_finalise_docs.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you need to collaborate to prepare a document, video, or other content, start one discussion thread and link or attach the key artifact in the context. <em>Large, complicated documents with multiple decisions or reviewers may require several threads; each thread might be a chapter or article.</em> ¹</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Use <strong>proposals</strong> and <strong>outcomes</strong> (once your proposal or poll has closed) ² so that everyone is clear on what’s next.</p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/Economic_Democracy_Advocates_quote.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="report-and-reflect"><a class="header" href="#report-and-reflect">Report and reflect</a></h2>
<p><em>Feedback, review, retrospect…</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_reflect.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>It’s valuable to invite reflection, evaluate how things have gone, and give and receive feedback. Many agile teams take advantage of our software, improving their retrospectives by using Loomio’s discussion threads.</p>
<p>Use one thread to report information to your group, such as weekly metric reports. If you expect a high volume of questions or comments on each report, then use one thread for each reflection.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Start a <strong>poll</strong> to collect input and more visibly track engagement… you may know what happens <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fW8amMCVAJQ">when the second person joins the dancing</a>.</p>
<h2 id="bonus-make-announcements"><a class="header" href="#bonus-make-announcements">BONUS: Make announcements</a></h2>
<p><em>Notify, acknowledge, track…</em></p>
<p><img src="guides/5_ways_to_use_threads/5_ways_ex_announcement.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Sometimes all you need to do is get the right information to the right people. You can use Loomio for your announcements, status updates, or even your newsletter. If you want everyone to receive it promptly, start your thread, choose your group members, and <strong>send</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Not ready to email everyone? You can always click <strong>members</strong> to send it later. Loomio can help you make sure everyone receives it (use <strong>see notifications</strong>).³</p>
<hr />
<p><strong>What about decisions, proposals and polls?</strong> The best tool for making decisions is good discussion; it's the best way to frame the topic, seek input, and gather ideas. Often you'll find that you can make progress with comments and replies. Other times, you will want the clear calls to engagement and facilitation support that polls and proposals can provide in order to bring the discussion to a clear outcome.</p>
<p>Now that you’ve learned some of the best practices for discussion threads that result in clear actionable outcomes or valuable shared understanding, try starting a “Wall” thread in your group, and share this article with your group!</p>

<p>Loomio combines a discussion forum with decision-making tools - encouraging more inclusive, deliberative and participative discussion and decision-making. </p>
<p>It helps you build shared understanding and to progress a discussion towards an outcome, building a record of decisions as you go.</p>
<h2 id="asynchronous-discussion-and-decision-making"><a class="header" href="#asynchronous-discussion-and-decision-making">Asynchronous discussion and decision-making</a></h2>
<p>It is often not possible to get all the people together at the same time and in the same place; whether in a physical meeting room, an online video call, or in a real-time chat room.</p>
<p>This means people can be left out of an important decision, or put under pressure in the moment to make a quick decision.</p>
<p>Asynchronous communication allows people to contribute to the discussion and decision at a time that works for them. It is more inclusive, gives people time to think and consider their response, and provides greater opportunity for more people to participate.</p>
<p>As an asynchronous collaboration tool, Loomio can help you include people, have open and diverse discussion, converge towards a clear decision and build an archive for your organization.</p>
<h2 id="integrating-loomio-with-real-time-and-document-management"><a class="header" href="#integrating-loomio-with-real-time-and-document-management">Integrating Loomio with real-time and document management</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is often used alongside real-time and document management collaborative tools.</p>
<p>Consider the collaboration tools your organization uses and the role each plays.</p>
<p><img src="guides/map-tools.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Real-time video call tools</strong> include Jitsi, Zoom or Teams. These are helpful tools for meeting together online and have come to replace many in-person meetings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio is not a real-time video tool; however you can use Loomio to prepare for your meeting, find a time to meet, upload and link documents, take notes and capture actions, and link to the video recording of the call - all within a 'thread'.</li>
</ul>
<p>Mattermost, Slack, Discord, Matrix and Microsoft Teams are <strong>real-time chat tools</strong>; used by working teams for instant communications - like we used to do across the office. Great for immediate feedback when working with team mates on a project, but messages can disrupt productive work, leave out team members who are unavailable at a particular time and hard to join the discussion later.  Chat tools are hard to organize into topics and to make a decision.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio is not a real-time chat tool; however comments and replies within threads update near-instantly. Threads help keep discussions on topic and to work towards an outcome.  Threads enable members to participate in their time without feeling the pressure to be constantly online.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Stored documentation tools</strong> such as a wiki, Google docs and OneDrive provide a repository for the important documents of your organization.  Documents are a snapshot in time, and quickly become out of date.  Collaborative editing and comments within the documents works well for two or three people, but challenging when seeking the feedback and approval from many people.</p>
<ul>
<li>Loomio is not a document repository tool; however documents and file can be uploaded, linked and organized in Loomio, so they can be found in context with the work to produce and maintain the documents.  Use a Loomio thread to engage people in creating documents, invite feedback and comments, update document with revisions and seek docuoment approval.</li>
</ul>

<p>We encourage community and volunteer groups with a special price.</p>
<p>The Community plan is available for community groups and organizations run by volunteers who have <strong>no full-time paid staff</strong>.</p>

<p>If you are in doubt whether the Community plan applies to your group, you may ask <em>“am I being paid by my organization to do this work?”</em> If yes, it’s likely a Loomio Starter or Pro plan is more appropriate for your organization. We trust you to make the right decision.</p>
<p>We will check in with you once a year, near the annual renewal date of your plan, to see if you are still actively using Loomio and if your group still meets the criteria for the Community plan. If your group has acquired funding and at least one full-time staff member, we will invite you to upgrade to the Loomio Starter or Loomio Pro plan.</p>

<h2 id="upgrading-your-group"><a class="header" href="#upgrading-your-group">Upgrading your group</a></h2>

<li>Billing Information (credit or debit card details)</li>
<li>Billing Address (to insure sales taxes are applied correctly)</li>
<li>Confirm details and click the <strong>Place My Order</strong> button.</li>

The billing system will continue to retry the payment once a week, and if payment is not successful after four (4) attempts, the subscription plan will be cancelled (day 28).</p>
<p>Card payment problems are often caused by:</p>
<ul>
<li>Insufficient funds</li>
<li>Expired card</li>
<li>Bank restrictions on new cards or changes to existing cards. </li>
</ul>
<p>Please make sure your credit or debit card is authorized for “international payments” and “internet transactions” (“Prch” and “Auth”).</p>

<p>You are invited to a one-hour implementation session to get set up with Loomio for your needs. It’s for you and people who will administer and facilitate Loomio groups in your organization.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>We usually follow up with a further 30 minute to 1 hour session to review progress and help you get the most from Loomio. </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>During the next 90 days and throughout the year, you are welcome to schedule additional 2-3 sessions as needed to develop collaborative practices online, prepare and review key events (such as a General Assembly) and implement decision-making workflow processes.</p>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Delivery of Pro support is usually via video call (e.g. Zoom), email and within Loomio. Many people find value inviting a Loomio expert to a private thread or subgroup  for questions and answers.</p>
<p>We’ll keep in contact with you about opportunities for how Loomio could work better for you and to introduce new features. </p>
<p>Pro plan customers receive priority support all year round; to answer questions, help onboard new administrators, and more.</p>

<h2 id="group-training"><a class="header" href="#group-training">Group training</a></h2>
<p>Tailored training to suit your organization’s needs.  Our group training starts by understanding your unique group needs, the current tools and processes your group use, so as to implement Loomio in the most useful way.</p>
<p>We then agree to a schedule of 2 x 60 minute online sessions to give your users confidence and mastery in achieving success with Loomio.</p>
<p>As your experience with Loomio builds, 1-2 follow up sessions are scheduled within the next 90 days to lift your use of Loomio and get more out of your tool in your environment.</p>
<h3 id="the-typical-package"><a class="header" href="#the-typical-package">The typical package</a></h3>
<p>Scoping. A half-hour session by teleconference (e.g. Zoom) to understand your organization needs in more detail, and map the ecosystem of digital and nondigital tools and processes you currently use to organize, communicate, record, &amp; decide with your group.</p>
<p>Implementation and training workshops to build confidence to introduce Loomio to your group (2 x 60 minute online sessions).</p>
<ul>
<li>The first session is typically for administrators and group coordinators to configure your Loomio group, set up first discussion threads, polls and proposals for initial engagement, and learn how to manage group members.</li>
<li>The second session can either be to assist you to introduce Loomio to your group users, or to dive deeper into Loomio features that can help administrators. The goal is for attendees to develop confidence and mastery in achieving outcomes with Loomio.</li>
</ul>
<p>Follow up workshops (one or two 30 minute online sessions), typically scheduled within 90 days. Workshops typically include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Review your experience of Loomio thus far, focusing on how well Loomio is integrating with your processes. Responding to questions arising and feedback from group members.</li>
<li>Adapting and further developing processes and refreshing use of Loomio features (or introducing newly developed features).</li>
<li>Mapping a path forwards.</li>
</ul>
<p>Online workshops are usually recorded so a video is made available for your review and to share with people who couldn’t join the workshop.</p>
<p><em>Also available:</em> In-person workshops for customers in New Zealand and Australia by arrangement. These will be at a location of your choosing and highly tailored to your needs. There may be additional costs with this package, especially for travel, and we’re happy to discuss a plan that makes the most sense for you.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="terms-of-service"><a class="header" href="#terms-of-service">Terms of Service</a></h1>
<p><em>All the terms that you agree to when you sign up for a Loomio product.</em></p>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-11-22</em></p>
<p>From everyone at Loomio, thank you for using our products! We build them to help you do your best work. There are thousands of people using Loomio products every day. Because we don't know every one of our customers personally, we have to put in place some Terms of Service to help keep the ship afloat.</p>
<p>When we say “Company”, “we”, “our”, or “us” in this document, we are referring to Loomio Limited.</p>
<p>When we say “Services”, we mean any product created and maintained by Loomio Limited, whether delivered within a web browser, desktop application, mobile application, or another format.</p>
<p>When we say “You” or “your”, we are referring to the people or organizations that own an account with one or more of our Services.</p>
<p>We may update these Terms of Service in the future. You can track changes <a href="https://github.com/loomio/loomio-docs/tree/main/en/src/policy">on GitHub</a>. Typically these changes have been to clarify some of these terms by linking to an expanded related policy. Whenever we make a significant change to our policies, we will also announce them on our <a href="https://blog.loomio.com">blog</a>.</p>
<p>When you use our Services, now or in the future, you are agreeing to the latest Terms of Service. That's true for any of our existing and future products and all features that we add to our Services over time. There may be times where we do not exercise or enforce any right or provision of the Terms of Service; in doing so, we are not waiving that right or provision. <strong>These terms do contain a limitation of our liability.</strong></p>
<p>If you violate any of the terms, we may terminate your account. That's a broad statement and it means you need to place a lot of trust in us. We do our best to deserve that trust by being open about <a href="https://www.loomio.com/about">who we are</a>, <a href="https://loomio.coop">how we work</a>, and keeping an open door to <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">your feedback</a>.</p>
<h2 id="account-terms"><a class="header" href="#account-terms">Account Terms</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>You are responsible for maintaining the security of your account and password. You must immediately notify Loomio of any unauthorized uses of your account, or any other breaches of security. Loomio cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.</li>
<li>You may not use the Services for any purpose outlined in our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/abuse">Use Restrictions policy</a>. You must not, in the use of the Service, violate any laws in your jurisdiction (including but not limited to copyright or trademark laws).</li>
<li>You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your account. That includes content posted by others who either: (a) have access to your login credentials; or (b) have their own logins under your account.</li>
<li>You must be a human. Accounts registered by “bots” or other automated methods are not permitted.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="payment-automatic-renewal-and-refunds"><a class="header" href="#payment-automatic-renewal-and-refunds">Payment, Automatic Renewal and Refunds</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>By selecting a subscription you agree to pay Loomio the annual or monthly subscription fees indicated for that service. When payments begin, they will be charged on a pre-pay basis and will cover the use of that service for the following subscription period as indicated.</li>
<li>If you are upgrading your plan, either from a trial or an existing paid plan, we will charge your card immediately and your billing cycle starts on the day of upgrade.</li>
<li>All fees are exclusive of all taxes, levies, or duties imposed by taxing authorities. Where required, we will collect those taxes on behalf of the taxing authority and remit those taxes to taxing authorities.</li>
<li>Unless you notify Loomio before the end of the applicable subscription period that you want to cancel a subscription, your subscription will automatically renew and you authorize us to collect the then-applicable fee for such subscription (as well as any taxes) using any credit card or other payment mechanism we have on record for you. Subscriptions can be canceled at any time via the billing portal or emailing contact@loomio.com.</li>
<li>When it comes to refunds, we treat our customers how we ourselves would like to be treated, and assess requests fairly. To process a refund, we must receive a request within 30 days of the date payment was made. Refunds are processed in the currency of the original transaction.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="cancellation-and-termination"><a class="header" href="#cancellation-and-termination">Cancellation and Termination</a></h2>
<p>We want satisfied customers, not hostages. That’s why we make it easy for you to cancel your account directly.</p>
<p><a href="policy/terms//en/policy/subscriptions/management#cancel-your-plan">Cancel your subscription</a></p>
<ol>
<li>Our legal responsibility is to subscription owners, which means we cannot cancel an account at the request of anyone else. If for whatever reason you no longer know who the account owner is, <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact us</a>. We will gladly reach out to any current account owners we have on file.</li>
<li>You are responsible for properly canceling your account. You can find instructions for how to cancel your account in our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/subscriptions/management#cancel-your-plan">Subscription help page</a>. An email or phone request to cancel your account is not automatically considered cancellation. If you need help canceling your account, you can always <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact our Support team</a>.</li>
<li>When you cancel, your group data will remain available, however you will no longer be able to start new threads or invite members to the group. After 30 days all content will be deleted from our active systems and you will no longer be able to access the data. If you want to export any data before your account is cancelled, we‘ve provided <a href="policy/terms//en/user_manual/groups/data_export">instructions</a>. Retrieving data for a group from a backup isn’t possible, so if you change your mind you’ll need to do it within the first 30 days. <strong>Data can’t be recovered once it has been permanently deleted.</strong></li>
<li>We won’t bill you again once you cancel. We don’t automatically prorate any unused time you may have left but if you haven’t used your account in months or just started a new billing cycle.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="loomio-initiated-cancellations"><a class="header" href="#loomio-initiated-cancellations">Loomio-initiated cancellations</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>We retain the right to suspend or terminate accounts for any reason at any time. In practice, this generally means we will cancel your account without notice if we have evidence that you are using our products to engage in <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/abuse">abusive behavior</a>.</li>
<li>We have the right to suspend or terminate your account and refuse any and all current or future use of our Services for any reason at any time. Suspension means you and any other users on your account will not be able to access the account or any content in the account. Termination will furthermore result in the deletion of your account or your access to your account, and the forfeiture and relinquishment of all content in your account. We also reserve the right to refuse the use of the Services to anyone for any reason at any time. We have this clause because statistically speaking, out of the thousands of accounts on our Services, there is at least one doing something nefarious. There are some things we staunchly stand against and this clause is how we exercise that stance. For more details, see our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/abuse">Use Restrictions policy</a>.</li>
<li>Verbal, physical, written or other abuse (including threats of abuse or retribution) of Company employee or officer will result in immediate account termination.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="modifications-to-the-service-and-prices"><a class="header" href="#modifications-to-the-service-and-prices">Modifications to the Service and Prices</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>We make a promise to our customers to support our Services. That means when it comes to security, privacy, and customer support, we will continue to maintain any legacy Services. Sometimes it becomes technically impossible to continue a feature or we redesign a part of our Services because we think it could be better or we decide to close new signups of a product. We reserve the right at any time to modify or discontinue, temporarily or permanently, any part of our Services with or without notice.</li>
<li>Sometimes we change the pricing structure for our products. When we do that, we tend to exempt existing customers from those changes. However, we may choose to change the prices for existing customers. If we do so, we will give at least 30 days notice and will notify you via the email address on record. We may also post a notice about changes on our websites or the affected Services themselves.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="uptime-security-and-privacy"><a class="header" href="#uptime-security-and-privacy">Uptime, Security, and Privacy</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>Your use of the Services is at your sole risk. We provide these Services on an “as is” and “as available” basis. If you require a Service Level Agreement please <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact us</a>.</li>
<li>We reserve the right to temporarily disable your account if your usage significantly exceeds the average usage of other customers of the Services. Of course, we'll reach out to the account owner before taking any action except in rare cases where the level of use may negatively impact the performance of the Service for other customers.</li>
<li>We take many measures to protect and secure your data through backups, redundancies, and encryption. We enforce encryption for data transmission from the public Internet. There are some edge cases where we may send your data through our network unencrypted. Please refer to our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/security">Security Overview</a> for full details.</li>
<li>When you use our Services, you entrust us with your data. We take that trust to heart. You agree that Loomio may process your data as described in our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/privacy">Privacy Policy</a> and for no other purpose. We as humans can access your data for the following reasons:</li>
</ol>
<ul>
<li><strong>To help you with support requests you make.</strong> If you contact us with a support inquiry, we may need to access your account to help resolve a problem.</li>
<li><strong>On the rare occasions when an error occurs that stops an automated process partway through.</strong> We get automated alerts when such errors occur. When we can fix the issue and restart automated processing without looking at any personal data, we do. In rare cases, we have to look at a minimum amount of personal data to fix the issue. In these rare cases, we aim to fix the root cause as much as possible to avoid the errors from reoccurring.</li>
<li><strong>To safeguard Loomio.</strong> We'll look at logs and metadata as part of our work to ensure the security of your data and the Services as a whole. If necessary, we may also access accounts as part of an <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/abuse">abuse report investigation</a>.</li>
<li><strong>To the extent required by applicable law.</strong> As a New Zealand based company with data infrastructure located in the US, EU and NZ we only preserve or share customer data if compelled by a US government authority with a legally binding order or proper request under the Stored Communications Act. If a non-US authority approaches Loomio for assistance, our default stance is to refuse unless the order has been approved by the US government, which compels us to comply through procedures outlined in an established mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement mechanism. If Loomio is audited by a tax authority, we only share the bare minimum billing information needed to complete the audit.</li>
</ul>
<ol start="5">
<li>We use third party vendors and hosting partners to provide the necessary hardware, software, networking, storage, and related technology required to run the Services. You can see a list of all subprocessors who handle personal data for <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/privacy/loomio-subprocessors">Loomio</a>.</li>
<li>You may request data related to your personal account and service. Loomio has the right to refuse repetitive or technically difficult requests. For information about how we collect and share user information please refer to our <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/privacy">Privacy Policy</a>.</li>
<li>Under the California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”), Loomio is a “service provider”, not a “business” or “third party”, with respect to your use of the Services. That means we process any data you share with us only for the purpose you signed up for and as described in these Terms of Service, <a href="policy/terms//en/policy/privacy">Privacy policy</a>, and other policies. We do not retain, use, disclose, or sell any of that information for any other commercial purposes unless we have your explicit permission. And on the flip-side, you agree to comply with your requirements under the CCPA and not use Loomio’s Services in a way that violates the regulations.</li>
<li>These Service Terms incorporate the <a href="policy/terms//en/Loomio_Data_Processing_Addendum_2021-11-22.pdf">Loomio Data Processing Addendum (“DPA”)</a>, when the General Data Protection regulation (“GDPR”) applies to your use of Loomio Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA is effective as of November 22, 2021 and replaces and supersedes any previously agreed data processing addendum between you and the Company relating to the GDPR. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact us</a> to request a signed DPA with your organization name, and name and email address of the person with authority to sign on behalf of your organization. Regardless of whether you execute or not, we protect and secure your data to the high standards set out in the addendum.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="content"><a class="header" href="#content">Content</a></h2>
<p>If you coordinate a group, comment in a discussion, post links in a discussion, or otherwise make (or allow any third party to make) material available through Loomio (any such material, “Content”), you are entirely responsible for the content of, and any harm resulting from, that Content. That is the case regardless of whether the Content in question constitutes text, graphics, an audio or video file, or computer software.</p>
<p>By making Content available, you represent and warrant that:</p>
<ol>
<li>The downloading, copying and use of the Content will not infringe the proprietary rights, including but not limited to the copyright, patent, trademark or trade secret rights, of any third party;</li>
<li>If your employer has rights to intellectual property you create, you have either (i) received permission from your employer to post or make available the Content, including but not limited to any software, or (ii) secured from your employer a waiver as to all rights in or to the Content;</li>
<li>You have fully complied with any third-party licenses relating to the Content, and have done all things necessary to successfully pass through to end users any required terms;</li>
<li>The Content does not contain or install any viruses, worms, malware, Trojan horses or other harmful or destructive content;</li>
<li>The Content is not spam, is not machine- or randomly-generated, and does not contain unethical or unwanted commercial content designed to drive traffic to third party sites or boost the search engine rankings of third party sites, or to further unlawful acts (such as phishing) or mislead recipients as to the source of the material (such as spoofing);</li>
<li>The Content is not pornographic, does not contain threats or incite violence, and does not violate the privacy or publicity rights of any third party;</li>
<li>Your group is not getting advertised via unwanted electronic messages such as spam links on newsgroups, email lists, other groups and web sites, and similar unsolicited promotional methods;</li>
<li>Your group is not named in a manner that misleads your readers into thinking that you are another person or company. For example, your group’s name is not the name of a company other than your own;</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="content-ownership-and-copyright"><a class="header" href="#content-ownership-and-copyright">Content Ownership and Copyright</a></h3>
<ol>
<li>All content posted on the Services must comply with copyright law.</li>
<li>We claim no intellectual property rights over the material you provide to the Services. All materials uploaded remain yours.</li>

<li>The names, look, and feel of the Services are copyright© to the Company. All rights reserved. You must request permission to use the Company's logo or any Service logos for promotional purposes.

<li>You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or exploit any portion of the Services, use of the Services, or access to the Services without the express written permission by the Company.</li>
<li>You must not modify another website so as to falsely imply that it is associated with the Services or the Company.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="features-and-bugs"><a class="header" href="#features-and-bugs">Features and Bugs</a></h2>
<p>We design our Services with care, based on our own experience and the experiences of customers who share their time and feedback. However, there is no such thing as a service that pleases everybody. We make no guarantees that our Services will meet your specific requirements or expectations.</p>
<p>We also test all of our features extensively before shipping them. As with any software, our Services inevitably have some bugs. We track the bugs reported to us and work through priority ones, especially any related to security or privacy. Not all reported bugs will get fixed and we don't guarantee completely error-free Services.</p>
<h2 id="services-adaptations-and-api-terms"><a class="header" href="#services-adaptations-and-api-terms">Services Adaptations and API Terms</a></h2>
<p>We offer Application Program Interfaces (&quot;API&quot;s) for some of our Services. Any use of the API, including through a third-party product that accesses the Services, is bound by the terms of this agreement plus the following specific terms:</p>
<ol>
<li>You expressly understand and agree that we are not liable for any damages or losses resulting from your use of the API or third-party products that access data via the API.</li>
<li>Third parties may not access and employ the API if the functionality is part of an application that remotely records, monitors, or reports a Service user's activity, both inside and outside the applications. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine if an integration service violates this bylaw. A third party that has built and deployed an integration for the purpose of remote user surveillance will be required to remove that integration.</li>
<li>Abuse or excessively frequent requests to the Services via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your account's access to the API. The Company, in its sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. If we need to suspend your account's access, we will attempt to warn the account owner first. If your API usage could or has caused downtime, we may cut off access without prior notice.</li>
</ol>
<p>Some third-party providers have created integrations between our Services and theirs. We are not liable or accountable for any of these third-party integrations.</p>
<h2 id="limitation-of-liability"><a class="header" href="#limitation-of-liability">Limitation of Liability</a></h2>
<p>This section is important as it outlines liability terms between us and both subscribers and invited users, so we urge you to read it closely and in full.</p>
<p>Other than liability that we can’t exclude or limit by law, our liability to you in connection with our services or these terms, in contract, tort (including negligence) or otherwise, is limited as follows:</p>
<p>We have no liability arising from your use of our services for any loss of revenue or profit, loss of goodwill, loss of customers, loss of capital, loss of anticipated savings, legal, tax or accounting compliance issues, damage to reputation, loss in connection with any other contract, or indirect, consequential, incidental, punitive, exemplary or special loss, damage or expense.</p>
<p>For loss or corruption of your data, our liability will be limited to taking reasonable steps to try and recover that data from our available backups.</p>

<h2 id="indemnity"><a class="header" href="#indemnity">Indemnity</a></h2>

<p>This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the Company and you concerning the subject matter hereof, and may only be modified by a written amendment signed by an authorized representative of the Company, or by the posting by the Company of a revised version. Any and all disputes arising of this agreement, termination, or our relationship with you shall be determined by binding arbitration under the Arbitration Act 1996 in Wellington, New Zealand, by one arbitrator who shall be a lawyer knowledgeable in relevant technology matters appointed by the President for the time being of the Arbitrators and Mediators Institute of New Zealand Incorporated (AMINZ) on a request by either you or Loomio. Notice must be given to apply for any interim measure in the arbitration proceeding.</p>
<ol>
<li>The arbitration proceeding will commence when a request is made to AMINZ to appoint an arbitrator.</li>
<li>The arbitration shall be in English. The Arbitrator in his or her discretion may permit the parties and witnesses to appear by video-conference.</li>
<li>The relationship we have with you under these terms is governed by New Zealand law.

<h2 id="subscription-account-owner"><a class="header" href="#subscription-account-owner">Subscription account owner</a></h2>
<p>Any person who is a member of a Loomio trial group can signup to a paid subscription for that group and become the subscription account owner.</p>
<p>Loomio subscription accounts are owned by the organization named during subscription account signup, if this is a legal entity. If the organization is unincorporated, the account is owned by the individual who signed up for the account.</p>
<p>At signup, the subscription account owner enters customer information (name, organization and email address), billing information (credit or debit card details) and billing address.  At completion of signup, the subscription is activated immediately and the Loomio group automatically upgraded to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>A tax invoice/statement is generated and sent to the email address provided by the account owner. The statement includes a secure link to the billing portal 'Account Management' at the bottom of the statement, where the account owner can access statements, update card and contact details, and cancel the subscription.  Access to the billing portal is available only to the registered account owner, and may be verified with a link sent to the account owner's email address. </p>
<p>Card updates and account ownership can be transferred to another person or organization by signing into the billing portal with the 'Account Management' link and editing account owner information.</p>
<p>Subscription account owners can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Manage the account’s subscription:</strong> including updating billing information, changing account owner, and cancelling the subscription account.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="loomio-group-administration"><a class="header" href="#loomio-group-administration">Loomio group Administration</a></h2>
<p>The administration of a Loomio group is done by Administrators. The person who originally started the Loomio group is by default an Administrator, and can grant Admin  priviledges to any member of the group.</p>
<p>Group administrators have access to all settings and permissions for the group.</p>
<p>Administrators can:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Edit group settings including privacy</strong> which means they can change the visibility and access to the Loomio group.</li>
<li><strong>Add and remove members, and set permissions</strong> which means they can change what group members can do in the group.</li>
<li><strong>Access and export all data in a group:</strong> that means they have the ability to read all content within the Loomio group.</li>
<li><strong>Grant and remove admin permissions:</strong> We encourage customers to share admin rights with someone you trust to help co-administer your Loomio group in the event you are unavailable.</li>

<p>If the account is owned by a legal entity, we at Loomio can reassign account management if provided with enough proof that the request is coming from a top-level organizational leader. To start a request to change the Account Manager, an owner or chief executive of the organization must <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact our support team</a>.</p>
<p>From there, we may ask for more verification of identity and relationship to the organization as well as ensure that there are no pending disputes of ownership. This process will likely take several days, as we need to make absolutely sure the request is legitimate.</p>
<p>If we’re unable to verify the legitimacy of the request, or if it’s being disputed by the current Account owner, we may require a properly served court order for Loomio Limited to proceed.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="use-restrictions"><a class="header" href="#use-restrictions">Use Restrictions</a></h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-10-27</em></p>
<p>Thousands of organizations use Loomio products. We are proud to give them a trusted platform to have discussions and make decisions. We also recognize that however good the maker’s intentions, technology can amplify the ability to cause great harm. That’s why we’ve established this policy. We feel an ethical obligation to counter such harm: both in terms of dealing with instances where Loomio is used (and abused) to further such harm, and to state unequivocally that Loomio is not a safe haven for people who wish to commit such harm. If you have an account with any of our products, you can’t use them for any of the restricted purposes listed below. If we find out you are, <a href="policy/abuse/index.html#how-we-handle-abusive-usage">we will take action</a>.</p>
<h2 id="restricted-purposes"><a class="header" href="#restricted-purposes">Restricted purposes</a></h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Violence, or threats thereof</strong>: If an activity qualifies as violent crime in Aotearoa New Zealand or where you live, you may not use Loomio products to plan, perpetrate, or threaten that activity.</li>
<li><strong>Child exploitation, sexualization, or abuse</strong>: We don’t tolerate any activities that create, disseminate, or otherwise cause child abuse.</li>
<li><strong>Doxing</strong>: If you are using Loomio products to share other peoples’ private personal information for the purposes of harassment, we don’t want anything to do with you.</li>
<li><strong>Malware or spyware</strong>: Code for good, not evil. If you are using our products to make or distribute anything that qualifies as malware or spyware — including remote user surveillance — begone.</li>
<li><strong>Phishing or otherwise attempting fraud</strong>: It is not okay to lie about who you are or who you affiliate with to steal from, extort, or otherwise harm others.</li>
<li><strong>Spamming</strong>: No one wants unsolicited commercial emails. We don’t tolerate folks (including their bots) using Loomio products for spamming purposes. If your emails don’t pass muster with <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/can-spam-act-compliance-guide-business">CAN-SPAM</a> or any other anti-spam law, it’s not allowed.</li>
<li><strong>Cybersquatting</strong>: We don’t like username extortionists. If you purchase a Loomio product account in someone else’s name and then try to sell that account to them, you are <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/15/1125">cybersquatting</a>. Cybersquatting accounts are subject to immediate cancelation.</li>
<li><strong>Infringing on intellectual property</strong>: You can’t use Loomio products to make or disseminate work that uses the intellectual property of others beyond the bounds of <a href="https://www.copyright.gov/fair-use/more-info.html">fair use</a>.</li>
</ul>
<p>While our use restrictions are comprehensive, they can’t be exhaustive — it’s possible an offense could defy categorization, present for the first time, or illuminate a moral quandary we hadn’t yet considered. That said, we hope the overarching spirit is clear: Loomio is not to be harnessed for harm, whether mental, physical, personal or civic. Different points of view — philosophical, religious, and political — are welcome, but ideologies like white nationalism, or hate-fueled movements anchored by oppression, violence, abuse, extermination, or domination of one group over another, will not be accepted here.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-report-abuse"><a class="header" href="#how-to-report-abuse">How to report abuse</a></h2>
<p>For cases of suspected malware, spyware, phishing, spamming, and cybersquatting, please alert us at <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a>.</p>
<p>For all other cases, please let us know by emailing <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a>. If you’re not 100% sure if something rises to the level of our use restrictions policy, report it anyway.</p>
<p>Please share as much as you are comfortable with about the account, the content or behavior you are reporting, and how you found it. Sending us a URL or screenshots is super helpful. If you need a secure file transfer, let us know and we will send you a link. We will not disclose your identity to anyone associated with the reported account.</p>
<p>Someone on our team will respond to let you know we’ve begun investigating. We will also let you know the outcome of our investigation (unless you ask us not to, or we are not allowed to under law).</p>
<h1 id="how-we-handle-abusive-usage"><a class="header" href="#how-we-handle-abusive-usage">How we handle abusive usage</a></h1>
<p>We build our products* to enable groups of people to make better, more inclusive decisions together. We are proud of that purpose and trust that our customers use our products for appropriate endeavors.</p>
<p>Sometimes, though, we discover potential abusive usage. When that happens, we investigate using the following guiding principles and process.</p>
<h2 id="guiding-principles"><a class="header" href="#guiding-principles">Guiding Principles</a></h2>
<h3 id="human-oversight"><a class="header" href="#human-oversight">Human oversight</a></h3>
<p>Who’s “we”, you ask? Our internal abuse oversight team includes our Loomio Cooperative members, and representatives from teams across Loomio Limited. On rare occasions for particularly sensitive situations or if legally required, we may also seek counsel from external experts.</p>
<h3 id="balanced-responsibilities"><a class="header" href="#balanced-responsibilities">Balanced responsibilities</a></h3>
<p>We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process.</p>
<h3 id="focus-on-evidence"><a class="header" href="#focus-on-evidence">Focus on evidence</a></h3>
<p>We base our decisions on the evidence available to us: what we see and hear account users say and do. We document what we observe and ask whether that observable evidence points to a restricted use.</p>
<h2 id="process"><a class="header" href="#process">Process</a></h2>
<p>Every case goes through the same general process:</p>
<ol>
<li>Discovery</li>
<li>Investigation</li>
<li>Decision, sometimes with right to an appeal</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="how-do-we-discover-potential-abuse"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-discover-potential-abuse">How do we discover potential abuse?</a></h3>
<p>From our experience, we learn about potential abuse because:</p>
<ul>
<li>Someone alerts us. We give abuse reports our full care and attention. Our Support team also responds to every question or comment that comes in. If we notice anything in those emails that points to a violation, we will look into it.</li>
<li>We notice an anomaly in our business operations monitoring. We monitor a range of things about our products, like signup volume and error rates of web requests. If we see something weird with those numbers, we get to the bottom of it.</li>
<li>We stumble upon public web content that links an individual or organization to a Loomio product. We aren’t scouring the Internet looking for those links, but if we do come across any, we check them out.</li>
</ul>
<p>This list is not exhaustive; there are always edge cases. We will update the list if we find regular new avenues.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-we-investigate"><a class="header" href="#how-do-we-investigate">How do we investigate?</a></h3>
<p>We focus on the evidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Language and imagery used by users on the account</li>
<li>Evidence of account users’ power and/or ability to act on spoken claims</li>
<li>Publicly available information about account users</li>
</ul>
<p>We strive to balance privacy and safety for all those involved:</p>
<ul>
<li>We make every effort to complete our investigations without accessing a customer account. For instance, if there are screenshots or public documents available, we review those. We also consider whether it is appropriate to involve the account owner in a given investigation and seek additional evidence from them.</li>
<li>As we review the evidence, we look for indications of existing negative impact. We also assess the severity of any potential negative impact, regardless of intent. When relevant, we look for and follow available guidelines from expert institutions.</li>
<li>If we cannot come to a fair assessment from the information available, we may decide to access a customer account without notice. We do not make this decision lightly. Customer privacy is a big deal to us and we only pursue this course of action if the evidence we have already is very concerning, but not definitive.</li>
</ul>
<p>While some violations are flatly obvious, others are subjective, nuanced, and difficult to adjudicate. We give each case adequate time and attention, commensurate with the violation, criticality, and severity of the charge.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-if-someone-really-broke-the-rules"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-if-someone-really-broke-the-rules">What happens if someone really broke the rules?</a></h3>
<p>We will terminate an account without advance notice if there is evidence it is being used for a restricted purpose that has, is, or will cause severe harm. If applicable, we will also report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p>For other cases, we’ll take a case-by-case approach to clear things up.</p>
<p>Further, as a small, privately owned independent business that puts our values and conscience ahead of growth at all costs, we reserve the right to deny service to anyone we ultimately feel uncomfortable doing business with.</p>
<h3 id="can-you-appeal-a-decision"><a class="header" href="#can-you-appeal-a-decision">Can you appeal a decision?</a></h3>
<p>If we terminate an account without notice, the decision is final.</p>
<p>For other cases, we will consider good faith appeals sent to <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a> by the account owner within 14 calendar days.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="privacy-policy"><a class="header" href="#privacy-policy">Privacy policy</a></h1>
<p><em>Last updated: 2021-10-08</em></p>
<p>The privacy of your data — and it is your data, not ours — is a big deal to us. In this policy, we lay out what data we collect and why, how your data is handled, and your rights to your data.</p>
<p>We promise we never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes.</p>
<p>This policy applies to all services built and maintained by Loomio Limited.</p>
<h2 id="what-we-collect-and-why"><a class="header" href="#what-we-collect-and-why">What we collect and why</a></h2>
<p>Our guiding principle is to collect only what we need. Here’s what that means in practice.</p>
<h3 id="identity--access"><a class="header" href="#identity--access">Identity &amp; access</a></h3>
<p>When you sign up for a Loomio product, we typically ask for identifying information such as your name, email address, and maybe a company or group name. That’s just so you can personalize your new account, and we can send you notices, invoices, updates, or other essential information. We also give you the option to add a profile picture that displays in our products, but we do not normally look at or access that picture. We’ll never sell your personal info to third parties, and we won’t use your name or company in marketing statements without your permission either.</p>
<h3 id="billing-information"><a class="header" href="#billing-information">Billing information</a></h3>
<p>When you pay for a Loomio product, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That’s so we can charge you for service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your name, billing address, organization name and billing information are handled directly by our subscription management service, and credit card information is handle by our payment processor.</p>
<h3 id="geolocation-data"><a class="header" href="#geolocation-data">Geolocation data</a></h3>
<p>We log all access to all accounts by full IP address so that we can always verify no unauthorized access has happened. We keep this login data for as long as your product account is active.</p>
<p>We also log full IP addresses used to sign up a product account. We keep this record forever because they are used to mitigate spammy signups.</p>
<p>Web analytics data — described further in the Website Interactions section — are also tied temporarily to IP addresses to assist with troubleshooting cases.</p>
<h3 id="website-interactions"><a class="header" href="#website-interactions">Website interactions</a></h3>
<p>When you browse our marketing pages or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information such as which operating system and browser version you are using. We track that information, along with the pages you are visiting, page load timing, and which website referred you for statistical purposes like conversion rates and to test new designs. We sometimes track specific link clicks to help inform some design decisions. These web analytics data are tied to your IP address and user account if applicable and you are signed into our Services.</p>
<h3 id="anti-bot-assessments"><a class="header" href="#anti-bot-assessments">Anti-bot assessments</a></h3>
<p>We use <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CAPTCHA">CAPTCHA</a> services across our applications to mitigate brute force logins and in Loomio as a means of spam protection. We have a legitimate interest in protecting our apps and the broader Internet community from credential stuffing attacks and spam. When you log into your accounts and fill specific forms in Loomio, the CAPTCHA service evaluates various information (e.g IP address, how long the visitor has been on the app, mouse movements) to check whether the data is possibly filled out by an automated program instead of a human.</p>
<h3 id="cookies-and-do-not-track"><a class="header" href="#cookies-and-do-not-track">Cookies and Do Not Track</a></h3>
<p>We do use persistent first-party cookies to store certain preferences, make it easier for you to use our applications, and support some in-house analytics. A cookie is a piece of text stored by your browser to help it remember your login information, site preferences, and more. You can adjust cookie retention settings in your own browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to view which cookies have been set and how to manage and delete them, please visit: <a href="https://www.allaboutcookies.org">www.allaboutcookies.org</a>.</p>
<p>At this time, our sites and applications do not respond to Do Not Track beacons sent by browser plugins.</p>
<h3 id="voluntary-correspondence"><a class="header" href="#voluntary-correspondence">Voluntary correspondence</a></h3>
<p>When you write Loomio with a question or to ask for help, we keep that correspondence, including the email address, so that we have a history of past correspondences to reference if you reach out in the future.</p>
<p>We also store any information you volunteer like surveys. Sometimes when we do customer interviews, we may ask for your permission to record the conversation for future reference or use. We only do so if you give your express consent.</p>
<h3 id="information-we-do-not-collect"><a class="header" href="#information-we-do-not-collect">Information we do not collect</a></h3>
<p>We don’t collect any characteristics of protected classifications including age, race, gender, religion, sexual orientation, gender identity, gender expression, or physical and mental abilities or disabilities. You may provide these data voluntarily, such as if you include a pronoun preference in your email signature when writing into our Support team.</p>
<p>We also do not collect any biometric data. You are given the option to add a picture to your user profile, which could be a real picture of you or a picture of something else that represents you best. We do not extract any information from profile pictures: they are for your use alone.</p>
<h2 id="when-we-access-or-share-your-information"><a class="header" href="#when-we-access-or-share-your-information">When we access or share your information</a></h2>
<p>Our default practice is to not access your information. The only times we’ll ever access or share your info are:</p>
<p><strong>To provide products or services you've requested</strong>. We do use some third-party services to run our applications and only to the extent necessary process some or all of your personal information via these third parties. You can view the list of third-party services we use <a href="policy/privacy/loomio-subprocessors/index.html">here</a>. Having subprocessors means we are using technology to access your data. No Loomio human looks at your data for these purposes unless an error occurs that stops an automated process from working and requires manual intervention to fix. These are rare cases and when they happen, we look for root cause solutions as much as possible to avoid them from reoccurring. We also use some other processors for other business functions, which you can view: <a href="policy/privacy/company-processors/index.html">Company processors</a>.</p>
<p><strong>To help you troubleshoot or squash a software bug or support request.</strong> We may need to access your account when you contact us asking for support to resolve a software bug or adminsitative issue.</p>
<p><strong>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding <a href="policy/privacy/../abuse/index.html">restricted uses</a>.</strong> Accessing a customer’s account when investigating potential abuse is a measure of last resort. We have an obligation to protect the privacy and safety of both our customers and the people reporting issues to us. We do our best to balance those responsibilities throughout the process. If we do discover you are using our products for a restricted purpose, we will report the incident to the appropriate authorities.</p>
<p><strong>When required under applicable law.</strong></p>
<p>Loomio Limited, is a New Zealand registered company, however our data infrastructure are located in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand.</p>
<ul>
<li>If law enforcement authorities have the necessary warrant, criminal subpoena, or court order requiring we share or preserve data, we have to comply. Otherwise, we reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data. And unless we’re legally prevented from it, we’ll always inform you when such requests are made. In the event a government authority outside New Zealand approaches Loomio with a request, our default stance is to refuse unless the New Zealand government compels us to comply through procedures outlined in a mutual legal assistance treaty or agreement.</li>
<li>If we get an informal request from any person, organization, or entity, we do not assist. If you are an account owner who wants to export data from their accounts, you can do so directly by following <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/data_export/">these instructions</a>.</li>
<li>If we are audited by a tax authority, we may be required to share billing-related information. If that happens, we only share the bare minimum needed such as billing addresses and tax exemption information.</li>
</ul>
<p>Finally, if Loomio Limited is acquired by or merged with another company — we don’t plan on that, but if it happens — we’ll notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</p>
<h2 id="user-content-and-personally-identifiable-information"><a class="header" href="#user-content-and-personally-identifiable-information">User Content and Personally Identifiable Information</a></h2>
<p>As a discussion and decision-making platform, Loomio stores and processes user generated Content; including discussions, comments, proposals, files and images.</p>
<p>We also store and process your “user profile”; including your name, email address, profile photo. This information can make a user personally identifiable, although you can use a pseudonym and anonymous email address to prevent this.</p>
<p>As a member of a Loomio group, your user profile and the content you create or upload to Loomio will be shared with the members of that group. Your email address will only be available to administrators of the group.</p>
<p>Content including your user profile will be public on the internet if you participate in a public discussion or join a public group.</p>
<p>You may view or correct your personal information at any time via the &quot;edit profile&quot; page within Loomio.</p>
<p>You may <em>delete</em> your user account. This will permanently delete your profile information including:</p>
<ul>
<li>Your user account including your name, email address, user id and other personally identifying data will be deleted from our systems.</li>
<li>Comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them.</li>
<li>You will no longer be listed as a member of any groups.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information"><a class="header" href="#your-rights-with-respect-to-your-information">Your rights with respect to your information</a></h2>
<p>At Loomio, we apply the same data rights to all customers, regardless of their location. Currently some of the most privacy-forward regulations in place are the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation (“GDPR”) and California Consumer Privacy Act (“CCPA”) in the US. Loomio recognizes all of the rights granted in these regulations, except as limited by applicable law. These rights include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Right to Know.</strong> You have the right to know what personal information is collected, used, shared or sold. We outline both the categories and specific bits of data we collect, as well as how they are used, in this privacy policy.</li>
<li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security and processing of that information.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> You have the right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Erasure / “To be Forgotten”.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession and, by extension, all of our service providers. Fulfillment of some data deletion requests may prevent you from using Loomio services because our applications may then no longer work. In such cases, a data deletion request may result in closing your account.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority. To identify your specific authority or find out more about this right, EU individuals should go to <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including opting out of sale of personal information. (Again: we never have and never will sell your personal data.)</li>
<li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
<li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> You have the right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
<li><strong>Right to Non-Discrimination.</strong> This right stems from the CCPA. We do not and will not charge you a different amount to use our products, offer you different discounts, or give you a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, the exercise of certain rights (such as the right “to be forgotten”) may, by virtue of your exercising those rights, prevent you from using our Services.</li>
</ul>
<p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information.</p>
<p>If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact@loomio.com</a>. For requests to delete personal information or know what personal information has been collected, we will first verify your identity using a combination of at least two pieces of information already collected including your user email address. If an authorized agent is corresponding on your behalf, we will first need written consent with a signature from the account holder before proceeding.</p>
<p>If you are in the EU, you can identify your specific authority to file a complaint or find out more about GDPR, at <a href="https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en">https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en</a>.</p>
<h2 id="how-we-secure-your-data"><a class="header" href="#how-we-secure-your-data">How we secure your data</a></h2>
<p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> when transmitted from our servers to your browser. The database backups are also encrypted.</p>
<p>In Loomio most data are not encrypted while they live in our database (since it needs to be ready to send to you when you need it), but we go to great lengths to secure your data at rest. For more information about how we keep your information secure, please review our <a href="policy/privacy/../security/index.html">security overview</a>.</p>
<h2 id="what-happens-when-you-delete-data-in-your-product-accounts"><a class="header" href="#what-happens-when-you-delete-data-in-your-product-accounts">What happens when you delete data in your product accounts</a></h2>
<p>We've designed our deletion policy and the features within Loomio based on our experience of supporting a variety of organizations with differing levels of technical competency and trust.</p>
<p>Our design strives to provide:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Flexibility</strong>. If you write something then want to change or remove it, you can.</li>
<li><strong>Accountability</strong>. If you write something then change it, there is a record of the changes.</li>
<li><strong>Recovery</strong> from mistakes and malicious actions. As an admin you can restore accidentally discarded records, and prevent group members from deleting records they should not delete.</li>
<li><strong>Safety and confidence</strong>. If you need something permanently deleted, you can do that.</li>
</ul>
<p>When it comes to discussions, comments, polls, votes, files and other records that are not user accounts, we have three functions available:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Discard</strong> will remove the record from view. Discarded records are automatically deleted 90 days after they were discarded.</li>
<li><strong>Restore</strong> can be used to reverse the discard action before the 90 day period has ended, bringing a record back to its normal state.</li>
<li><strong>Delete</strong> will immediately and irreversibly delete a record. When a record is deleted, it cannot be restored.</li>
</ul>
<p>Our application database has 4 day point-in-time recovery, meaning that 4 days after you delete a record it has been completely removed from our systems and backups.</p>
<p>If you accidentally delete a record, we do not offer recovery from these backups.</p>
<h2 id="deleting-your-user-account"><a class="header" href="#deleting-your-user-account">Deleting your user account</a></h2>
<p>If you choose to delete your Loomio user account, we will remove your user profile including your user ID, name, email address, profile photo and other known personally identifying information. However, communication history (such as comments and votes) will be kept to preserve the integrity of discussions and decisions within your groups.</p>
<p>If you wish to have comments or other data deleted from a group that you are not an administrator of, you should contact the group administrator and request deletion of that data.</p>
<p>Data deletion requests may be made to the data protection officer via email (dpo@loomio.com). Loomio may delete user data at the request of law enforcement or if personal safety is at risk.</p>
<h2 id="location-of-site-and-data"><a class="header" href="#location-of-site-and-data">Location of site and data</a></h2>
<p>Our products and other web properties are operated in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand. If you are using one of our services located outside of the country you reside, <strong>please be aware that any information you provide to us will be transferred to and stored in the location of the regional service</strong>. By using our service, participating in any of our services and/or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>
<h2 id="when-transferring-personal-data-from-the-eu"><a class="header" href="#when-transferring-personal-data-from-the-eu">When transferring personal data from the EU</a></h2>
<p>The GDPR requires that any data transferred out of the EU must be treated with the same level of protection that the EU privacy laws grant. Loomio has offered a data processing addendum.</p>
<p>We have incorporated a Data Processing Addendum to our <a href="policy/privacy/../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a> that is in effect when the GDPR applies to your use of Loomio Services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (both controller-processor and controller-controller) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. The DPA is extensive so to aid our customers, we have provided both a summary of what they mean and how Loomio Limited upholds our responsibilities in our <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/index.html">Privacy Regulation Reference</a>. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact us</a> to request a signed DPA with your organization name, and name and email address of the person with authority to sign on behalf of your organization.

<p><em>Last updated: 2021-11-03</em></p>
<p>The data privacy regulatory landscape is undergoing a lot of change. You probably have heard about the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) that went into effect on May 25, 2018. There are also other regulations in effect or in the works around the world. We’ve written up this reference document to put helpful information regarding our products and privacy regulations in one place. Please also view our full <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../index.html">Privacy policy</a>.</p>
<p>If you have any questions, comments, or concerns about our <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../index.html">Privacy policy</a>, your data, or your rights with respect to your information, please email us at <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a>.</p>
<h2 id="european-union-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr"><a class="header" href="#european-union-general-data-protection-regulation-gdpr">European Union General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR)</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is a New Zealand registered company, however our data infrastructure is located in the United States, European Union, Australia and New Zealand. That means your data is transferred to the country where the data infrastructure is resident. The EU has strong privacy laws and a core tenet of the GDPR is that if you transfer any personal data of EU residents out of the EU, you must protect it to the same level as guaranteed under EU law. There are two factors to this:</p>
<ol>
<li>The practices that businesses take handling personal data; and</li>
<li>The laws of the countries where you transfer the EU personal data to</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="practices-we-have-at-loomio"><a class="header" href="#practices-we-have-at-loomio">Practices we have at Loomio</a></h3>
<p>We are serious about treating our customers fairly. We respect your privacy and will never sell your data to third parties, nor put advertising into Loomio. You have control of your data and right to privacy. The security measures we put in place are to protect your personal data. These principles apply to all of our customers, regardless of where you are in the world.</p>
<p>Please read our <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../index.html">Privacy Policy</a> and our <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../../security/index.html">Security Overview</a> in full. Some highlights:</p>
<ul>
<li>We never have and never will sell customer data.</li>
<li>We don’t run ads for other services in our products.</li>
<li>We limit the data we collect: if we don’t need it, we don’t ask for it.</li>
<li>We limit the permissions our apps request on your devices.</li>
<li>We put a lot of security measures into place including in-transit encryption, encryption at-rest, and requiring employees and contractors to sign non-disclosure agreements.</li>
<li>When you email us at <a href="mailto:contact@loomio.com">contact@loomio.com</a>, someone from our team will get back to you. You are always speaking with a human! No bots.</li>
</ul>
<p>We do work with sub-processors. You can see a list of current sub-processors at <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../loomio-subprocessors/index.html">Loomio Subprocessors</a> and <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../company-processors/index.html">Company Processors</a>. With each vendor, we assess their commitment to privacy and ensure they have GDPR-compliant data processing agreements in place that include the controller-processor <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/info/law/law-topic/data-protection/international-dimension-data-protection/standard-contractual-clauses-scc_en">Standard Contractual Clauses</a>.</p>
<h3 id="data-processing-addendum"><a class="header" href="#data-processing-addendum">Data processing addendum</a></h3>
<p>We have incorporated a Data Processing Addendum (DPA) to our <a href="policy/privacy/regulations/../../terms/index.html">Terms of Service</a>. You can find the DPA linked within the Uptime, Security and Privacy section. This addendum is in effect when the General Data Protection Regulation applies to your use of Loomio services to process Customer Data as defined in the DPA. The DPA includes the European Commission’s Standard Contractual Clauses (both controller-processor and controller-controller) to extend GDPR privacy principles, rights, and obligations everywhere personal data is processed. If you prefer to have an executed copy of the Data Processing Addendum, <a href="https://www.loomio.com/contact">contact us</a> to request a signed DPA with your organization name, and name and email address of the person with authority to sign on behalf of your organization. We provide the same privacy rights and protection to all customers, regardless of whether they choose to execute a DPA. </p>
<h2 id="california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa"><a class="header" href="#california-consumer-privacy-act-ccpa">California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA)</a></h2>
<p>In the CCPA, there is an important distinction between what are referred to as “service providers”, “businesses”, and “third parties”. You can see how the regulation defines these words by visiting the California Attorney General’s website: https://www.oag.ca.gov/privacy/ccpa.</p>
<p><em>Under the CCPA, Loomio is a “service provider.”</em> That means when we process data you provide, we do so solely for the purpose you signed up for. Our business model is simple: we charge a recurring subscription fee to our customers. We do not sell personal information or use your data for any other commercial purposes unless with your explicit permission.</p>
<p>The CCPA also grants residents of California with additional rights related to their information. We grant those rights to all of our customers and detail them in our Privacy policy. Our Privacy policy also explains the information we collect in order to provide our services and clearly lists the only times we access or share your data.</p>
