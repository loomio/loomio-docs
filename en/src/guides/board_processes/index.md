## Prepare for a meeting

### Actions and meeting focus

Use Loomio to prepare for your next meeting by involving people from the outset - to establish a focus for the meeting and co-create the agenda. This will help everyone align towards the most important issues, making better use of your precious time together.

There are several things you likely do to prepare for your next board or committee meeting:
- ensure the focus of the meeting is about the most important things
- follow up and talk to members about actions from previous meetings

#### On Loomio
Use a Loomio **Thread** to prepare for your board meeting:
* notify directors about the next meeting
* invite comment about the most important things to focus on

### Agenda and notify people

Use Loomio to announce the agenda for your next meeting, attach papers, link to key documents and notify people. 

While similar to sending an email, a Loomio thread enables you to see who has read the thread.  

Any member questions or comments are visible to everyone in your Loomio group, reducing email chains and duplication of answers.

This helps everyone prepare for the meeting so they arrive in context and ready for the most important work.

Actions: 
- prepare documents, materials and board papers
- notify members and send papers

## Why does your board need an online place for discussion and decisions?

Good governance exists where an organization has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organization to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”*

Underpinning all of these principles is the need for good communication.

Here are some or the challenges directors and boards experience:

* Getting directors together in person
* Time available to consider important issues 
* Urgency of critical issues
* Online video meeting fatigue
* Directors in multiple, remote locations, sometimes with poor internet connectivity
* Mixed governance practice and experience
* Dealing with high volumes of transactional business 

Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion while documenting everything.
