Good governance is more than a board meeting, it requires good communication before and after meetings.

This guide is intended to help you use Loomio in your board or committee, so you can stay connected between meetings, deal with urgent matters and reduce board admin.
- Continue governance between meetings
- Use board meetings for issues that matter
- Keep a detailed record

Loomio is a versatile discussion and decision-making tool for collaborative boards and committees.

## Governance practices and approaches

Good governance includes establishing, reviewing and challenging governance practices, policies and procedures to continously improve board effectiveness.

However many boards are short on time and often weighed down by board papers, compliance and risk, without sufficient time to discuss and debate critical strategy and performance issues.

#### On Loomio
Loomio offers the opportunity to work online on a document, policy or procedure.  Discussion and decisions are contained in a thread that members can access when and wherever works for them.  

Use a **thread** for each document, policy or procedure. The thread is the container for discussion, and holds document drafts and subsequent versions of the document.  

With a Loomio thread, you can organize so that the 2-3 people working on the document text are discussing particulars in the thread.  The thread could be private amongst just those 2-3 people, or run openly in the group so that the work is transparent to all members.

When the document reaches a draft version, use a **Sense check poll** to notify members that the draft document is ready for review, and invite members to read the document and respond with any comments or questions.  As well as letting everyone know that the work is progressing, the poll closing date encourages people to participate.

The document may require several draft iterations.

When a 'final' draft is ready, raise a **Proposal** to approve the document.

Loomio enables a board to progress work on governance improvement between meetings without eating into precious time in meetings.

## Why does your board need an online place for discussion and decisions?

Good governance exists where an organization has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organization to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”* [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf).

Underpinning all of these principles is the need for good communication.

Here are some or the challenges directors and boards experience:

* Getting directors together in person
* Time available to consider important issues 
* Urgency of critical issues
* Online video meeting fatigue
* Directors in multiple, remote locations, sometimes with poor internet connectivity
* Mixed governance practice and experience
* Dealing with high volumes of transactional business 

Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion while documenting everything.
