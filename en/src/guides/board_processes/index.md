## Prepare for a meeting

Effective meetings are productive, inclusive, and collaborative - they help build strong relationships, establish alignment, make better and faster decisions, promote inclusion, facilitate creative thinking and innovation, are a great channel for feedback and continuous improvement, and improve engagement.

Use Loomio to prepare for your next meeting by involving people from the outset, align towards the most important topics, and make better use of your precious time together.

There are several things you can do to prepare for an effective board or committee meeting...

### Meeting focus and review actions

Establish a focus for the meeting so you talk about the most important topics.  

Inviting members to contribute to the agenda helps everyone align, think about topics and energize for the meeting.

Actions:
- focus the meeting on the most important things
- follow up and talk to members about actions from previous meetings

#### On Loomio
Use a Loomio **Thread** to prepare for your meeting:
* remind members about the meeting coming up
* invite comment about the most important things to focus on
* summarize actions from the previous meeting and ask for an update

### Agenda and notify people

Announce the meeting with a clear agenda. Attach papers, link to key documents and notify members. 

This helps everyone prepare for the meeting by reading the materials and thinking about topics of discussions and decisions to be made.  People are then more likely to arrive in context and ready.

Actions: 
- prepare agenda, documents, materials and board papers
- notify members of meeting and send materials

#### On Loomio
Use a Loomio **Thread** to prepare for your board meeting:
* state details of meeting
* attach or link agenda, documents and other meeting materials
* invite members with a notification
* monitor 'Seen by' to see who has read the thread

While similar to sending an email, a Loomio thread has advantages:
- you can see who has read the thread
- member replies or comments are visible to everyone who has permission to view the thread
- any discussion or questions about the agenda or meeting materials is held in a single place

So members can find all the information about the meeting readily available in one place, thereby avoiding confusing email chains and important info lost in email inboxes.

## Why does your board need an online place for discussion and decisions?

Good governance exists where an organization has systems and processes in place that are appropriate to its circumstances, and which enable the organization to pursue its purpose effectively and meet its obligations under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”*

Underpinning all of these principles is the need for good communication.

Here are some or the challenges directors and boards experience:

* Getting directors together in person
* Time available to consider important issues 
* Urgency of critical issues
* Online video meeting fatigue
* Directors in multiple, remote locations, sometimes with poor internet connectivity
* Mixed governance practice and experience
* Dealing with high volumes of transactional business 

Loomio offers an opportunity to strengthen governance, to extend collaboration beyond board meetings, to include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion while documenting everything.
