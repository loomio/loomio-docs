# Introducing Loomio to your board

Loomio can become the online place where your board or committee meet, discuss, decide and build an auditable record for your organization.

However Loomio will be of little value if only some of your board participate.  Information and communication will likely remain scattered over multiple tools, lost in email inboxes and the confusion will waste everyone's time.

We recommend you commit as a board to move to Loomio, and everyone makes a genuine effort.  

As administrator your primary objective is to set up Loomio effectively for your board.

Aim to encourage directors to join and participate. They should be easily able to:

- Sign in to Loomio
- Read and comment on threads
- Vote in polls
- See how your governance practices work in Loomio

Send this 6 minute video to members to help them sign in, comment and vote.

## Check technical proficiency 

Board members will need a computer or smartphone connected to the internet. They must be capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, reading digital documents, viewing and hearing videos.

Check that members have all of the following:

- an up-to-date deviceâ€”a computer, tablet or smart phone with email and a modern internet browser
- internet service via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)
- capability to send and receive email, browse the internet, download documents and play videos.

Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old out-of-date browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer may not work.

If you have a problem using Loomio on your device, [Contact Loomio support](https://loomio.com/contact).
