Reach collective agreement with everyone involved.

Build consensus for a decision you need to make together, to reach an agreement that satisfies the needs and concerns of all participants.

> *“Consensus is the process – a participatory process by which a group thinks and feels together, en route to their decision.” - Sam Kaner, Community at Work*

### Key points
- Discuss and develop a proposal together
- Include and respect everyone involved
- Seek agreement from most people

**Consensus is typically used in:**
- Working teams building shared understanding of an issue or opportunity, collaborating on a proposal and deciding course of action. 
- Governance board decisions where the board shows it is acting jointly, such as decisions on vision, policy, strategic planning and budget.
- AGMs and General Assemblies where members and stakeholders seek general agreement for major decisions, such as revisions to statutes, major transactions and the elections of directors or council members.

### Consensus process steps
1. You notice a problem or opportunity and take the initiative.
2. State the problem or issue to be decided - start a Loomio **thread**.
3. Prepare and present a proposal to test for consensus - start a **Sense check proposal**.
4. Discuss, clarify and amend the proposal  - facilitate discussion in the thread.
5. Test for agreement - start a **Consensus proposal**.
6. Outcome - state the decision **outcome**.

### Benefits
- Grow shared understanding.
- Decisions for the collective will of the group.
- Encourage people to value the group over their personal preferences.

## Applying the Consensus process on Loomio

| **Consensus process** | **On Loomio** |
|---|---|
| You notice a problem or opportunity and take the initiative. |  |
| **State the issue to be decided**  <br /><br />Provide background information and open a broad ranging discussion to build shared understanding. Look for emerging proposals. | Start a Loomio thread <br /><br />Name the topic of discussion in the thread title, and what you hope to achieve. <br /><br />Attach or link to background information. Invite people to ask questions, contribute information and write comments. |
| **Present a proposal** <br /><br />Test for consensus. | Run a **Sense check proposal**. <br /><br />*In the title:* Name the proposal. <br /><br />*In the proposal details:* Clearly frame the proposal and say why it is important.  Include any background information necessary and a link to the proposal.  <br /><br />Invite everyone to respond, and to do so before the proposal closes.  |
| **Amendment** <br /><br />Discuss, clarify and amend the proposal  | Facilitate discussion in the thread to address concerns and modify the proposal. |
| **Agreement** <br /><br />Do you have an agreement?  Check for: <br /><br />Agreement: I support the proposal. <br /><br />Abstain: This decision does not affect me and I am happy with whatever the group decides. <br /><br />Disagreement: Something in the proposal needs to be changed before I can support it. <br /><br />Block: I have a fundamental disagreement with the proposal that cannot be resolved. | Run a **Consensus proposal** with the current proposal version. <br /><br />*In the title:* Name the decision to be made. <br /><br />*In the proposal details:* Present the proposal and invite people to vote. <br /><br />Include a clear statement of what agreement means, say 'for this proposal to pass, we need everyone to vote agree' or 'for this proposal to pass, we need 75% of members to agree'.  <br /><br />Ask participants to leave a vote 'Reason' - and if they do not agree to say why, and what needs to change for them to agree. <br /><br />Some organizations also use the Block (or veto) voting option. <br /><br />As voting progresses, respond to comments, post updates, close early, or let the proposal run to conclusion. <br /><br />Participants can *“change vote”* up to proposal close time, say in response to new information that arrives during voting. |
| **Outcome** <br /><br />State if agreement was reached and the decision that has been made. <br /><br />Implement the decision and plan actions to be taken. | Consider voting results and state the decision made. <br /><br />Summarize results of the process and say what will happen next. <br /><br />If results are inconclusive, you may choose to re-open the discussion and run a new proposal. <br /><br />The outcome statement is an important record of the decision for future reference. |

## Example of a Consensus process on Loomio

### Step 1. You notice a problem or opportunity and take the initiative

*Is the problem or opportunity is worth pursuing?* Vivien noticed it's time to review the Oatmilk Coop brand.

*Is there a decision to be made?* The governance board has responsibility to approve a new brand concept.

*Does it impact other people and your organization?* Brand impacts on the perception of the co-op and impacts everyone in the organization. 

### Step 2. State the problem or issue

Vivien starts a Loomio thread outlining the need to review the organization's brand, inviting participation to develop a new brand concept, and that the approval decision is to be made by the governance board using the consensus process.

### Step 3. Present a proposal 

Vivien runs a Sense check proposal to survey opinions to see how people feel about key elements of the brand concept, and test for consensus.   The Sense check proposal lets people know a proposal is forming and encourages them to engage.  It's a good way to surface concerns.

### Step 4. Amendment

When the Sense check proposal closes, Vivien states an outcome and notifies everyone about the results and what will happen next.
Vivien facilitates a discussion to address concerns and modify the Brand Concept document.

### Step 5. Agreement

Having completed the latest version of the Brand Concept document, Vivien is now ready to seek approval from the governance board by running a Consensus proposal.

Governance board members are invited to vote and approve the Brand Concept.  The board has previously agreed that proposals like this require >75% of members to vote Agree for it to pass. 

The standard Consensus proposal includes the 'Block' voting option, however this can be removed if not appropriate.

### Step 6. Outcome

When the Consensus proposal closes, Vivien states an outcome and notifies everyone that agreement has been reached, and that work to implement the new brand will commence.
