# Consensus process

![](better_collaboration.png)

Reach collective agreement with everyone involved.

Build consensus for a decision you need to make together, to reach an agreement that satisfies the needs and concerns of all participants.

> *“Consensus is the process – a participatory process by which a group thinks and feels together, en route to their decision.” - Sam Kaner, Community at Work*

### Key points
- Discuss and develop a proposal together
- Include and respect everyone involved
- Seek agreement from most people

Consensus is typically used in:
- Working teams building shared understanding of an issue or opportunity, collaborating on a proposal and deciding course of action. 
- Governance board decisions where the board shows it is acting jointly, such as decisions on vision, policy, strategic planning and budget.
- AGMs and General Assemblies where members and stakeholders seek general agreement for major decisions, such as revisions to statutes, major transactions and the elections of directors or council members.

### Consensus process steps
1. You notice a problem or opportunity and take the initiative.
2. State the problem or issue to be decided - start a Loomio **thread**.
3. Prepare and present a proposal to test for consensus - start a **Sense check proposal**.
4. Discuss, clarify and amend the proposal  - facilitate discussion in the thread.
5. Test for agreement - start a **Consensus proposal**.
6. Outcome - state the decision **outcome**.

### Benefits
- Grow shared understanding.
- Decisions for the collective will of the group.
- Encourage people to value the group over their personal preferences.
