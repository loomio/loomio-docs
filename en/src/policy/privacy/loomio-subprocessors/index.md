# Loomio subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Loomio (the service). We ensure each subprocessor has GDPR-compliant data processing agreements, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use.

- [DigitalOcean](https://www.digitalocean.com/security/gdpr/) - Cloud computing services. The majority of our application stack is on Digital Ocean.
- [Amazon Web Services](https://aws.amazon.com/compliance/gdpr-center/) - Cloud computing services. We use S3 for file uploads and SES for sending emails.
- [Chargify](https://help.chargify.com/my-account/gdpr.html) - Billing and subscription management
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/gdpr/introduction/) - Security and performance
- [Google Cloud Platform](https://cloud.google.com/security/gdpr/resource-center/) - Cloud services provider. We use Google Translate and Google account authentication on Sign in.
- [Open AI](https://trust.openai.com/) - If you record an audio message it will be transcribed by OpenAI.
- [Google reCAPTCHA](https://developers.google.com/recaptcha/) - Anti-bot protection.
- [Windcave](https://sec.windcave.com/pxmi3/privacy-policy) - Creditcard payment processor
