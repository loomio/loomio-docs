# Loomio subprocessors

We use third party subprocessors, such as cloud computing providers and customer support software, to run Loomio (the service). We ensure each subprocessor has GDPR-compliant data processing agreements, extending [GDPR safeguards](../regulations/index.md) everywhere personal data is processed.

The following is a list of personal data subprocessors we use.

Update 2023-06-28 - We've moved our main database and application servers to Digital Ocean. We no longer use Heroku.
