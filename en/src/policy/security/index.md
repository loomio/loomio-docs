# Security overview
_Keeping customer data secure is a a top priority for us. Here’s how we make it happen._

### We're working towards ISO27001 certification

You can view our [RiskLedger Trust Center page](https://app.riskledger.com/p/shared/6cc1455fbe514c03ba6cbb9cab716889) to review our security policies in the pre-audit phase.

### Practices we have at Loomio

* We never have and never will sell customer data.
* We don’t run ads for other services in our products.
* We limit the data we collect: if we don’t need it, we don’t ask for it.
* We put a lot of security measures into place including in-transit encryption and encryption at-rest.
* We do not access customer data unless granted permission by customer to support resolution of a problem, or if necessary to maintain the service.

## Trustworthy staff

Employee and contractor agreements for people working at Loomio include confidentiality clauses to protect Loomio and customer confidential information. We treat all customer information and data as confidential, except for situations where a customer has explicitly made the information publicly accessible.

Loomio Limited is a for-profit social enterprise owned by worker-owned Loomio Cooperative. Loomio staff are either cooperative members or on a path to cooperative membership, and share the values and responsibilities of Loomio as business co-owners. [You can read about us here](https://www.loomio.com/about).

Access to data is tightly controlled and protected internally within Loomio. 

## We protect your data

All data are written to multiple disks instantly, backed up daily, and stored in multiple secure locations. Files that our customers upload are stored on servers that use modern techniques to remove bottlenecks and points of failure.

## Loomio is open source software

This means the code is open to view, but your data is not. There are many benefits including that many people have read our code and review changes as they go in. We've got nothing to hide - there are no backdoors in Loomio. We do not hold your data to ransom, you can export your data at any time and run your own Loomio server.
