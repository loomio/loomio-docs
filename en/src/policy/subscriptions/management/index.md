Loomio uses Maxio billing and subscription management service to manage subscription records, initiate payments, process upgrades and cancellations.

Prices are based on debit/credit card payment via an automated billing portal.

## Upgrading your group
To continue to use Loomio beyond your free trial, you can upgrade your group to a paid subscription plan.

You may upgrade your group at any time by clicking the __VIEW PLANS__ button.

![The View plans button](view-plans.png)

Choose the right plan for your organization's needs and click the __BUY NOW__ button.

In the billing portal complete the required fields to set up your subscription with your credit or debit card, including:
- Customer Information (name and email address)
- Billing Information (credit or debit card details)
- Billing Address (to insure sales taxes are applied correctly)
- Confirm details and click the __Place My Order__ button.

The subscription is activated immediately and the group automatically upgraded. 

A tax invoice/statement confirming successful payment will be sent to your email address.

You will also receive an email a secure link to the billing portal for your subscription, where you can manage your account, update credit card and contact details, and download current or past statements.

The link is only valid for 30 days, so please follow it as soon as you get a chance.

### Automatic payment and statement generation
Your credit or debit card details are held securely by Maxio, our subscription management service provider, for future recurring payments.  [Maxio](https://www.chargify.com/security/) is PCI DSS Level 1 Compliant.

Monthly or annual payments via Maxio are automatic, and an invoice/statement is issued on successful payment.

## Billing problems
Maxio may be unable to process a payment to your card when due.

If a payment is unsuccessful, an email notification will be sent to the email address we have on file, along with a link to the billing portal where you can update card details. The billing system will continue to retry the payment once a week, and if payment is not successful after four (4) attempts, the subscription plan will be cancelled (day 28).

Card payment problems are often caused by:
- Insufficient funds
- Expired card
- Bank restrictions on new cards or changes to existing cards. 
 
Please make sure your credit or debit card is authorized for “international payments” and “internet transactions” (“Prch” and “Auth”).

The billing system will issue an alert via email when your credit card is nearing expiry.

## Alternate payment options
Alternate payment options are only available for annual plan subscriptions.

### Payment via invoice and bank transfer
Contact us to set up payment via invoice and bank transfer.

### Payment via bank transfer must be made within 20 days of invoice.
Bank and international transfer fees must be added to the payment so that the full subscription fee due is paid.

There is an administration charge for manual invoice and purchase order processing of $US 25.00.

### Other currencies
Invoices raised in currencies other than in USD are converted at the daily Telegraphic Transfer rate plus 5%.
