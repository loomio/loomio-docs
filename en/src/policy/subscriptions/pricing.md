# Subscription pricing
_How we price Loomio to make it available to everyone._

# Overview
Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You own your own content and you are free to export your data at any time.

## Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.

We aim to offer a competitive price for enterprise organizations, an affordable price for businesses, nonprofit organizations and community groups.

Loomio is open source software, and you are free to set up your own instance of Loomio for internal use in your organization.  

We offer services to help you set up and operate Loomio on a private server.

# Loomio Cloud subscription plans
