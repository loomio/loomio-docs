## Security and data privacy
### Who owns my group’s data?
You do! Unlike some other services, we're not in the advertising business. You are the customer, not the product, and you're in charge. Loomio is open source software, and your data is portable and exportable. You can download your group’s data and open it in a spreadsheet or even export your entire group history to run on your own Loomio server - if you have the skillset, time and resources. 
However you have our promise that we'll run our loomio.com service for our customers until the end of the internet.

### Is my data secure?
Keeping customer data safe and secure is a huge responsibility and a top priority. We work hard to protect our customers from the latest threats. See [Security overview ](https://help.loomio.com/en/policy/security) for details on how we protect your data. Your input and feedback on our security is always appreciated.

### Where are Loomio cloud services hosted?
Our global service at loomio.com is hosted in the USA, operated by Heroku and running on Amazon Web Services data center.

Our regional services loomio.eu run on Amazon Web Services in the Netherlands, and loomio.nz on Amazon Web Services in Australia.

### Why should we trust Loomio?
We've been in business for more than 10 years. We have great relationships with our customers. We're run by a worker-owned cooperative - which means the people who create Loomio also have ownership in it. 

We work with people who support our social mission, and are committed to ensuring we provide the highest level of privacy and protection for our customer’s data. 

Our software is open source, which means anyone can download and read the code.

Loomio is based in Aotearoa, New Zealand, ranked by the World Bank and Forbes as the best country in the world to do business, as well as lacking red tape and corruption.

### Do you offer private servers or support for self-hosting?
We can run a private Loomio installation configured to suit your organization, on a server of your choice.  We can also support you with a self-hosted service.  [Talk to us to discuss your needs!](https://www.loomio.com/contact)

### What happens to my data if I stop using Loomio?
If you cancel your plan, your group data will remain available for 30 days. However you will no longer be able to start new threads or invite members to the group.
We recommend that you download everything you want to keep. 
After 30 days from cancellation, your group and all content will be deleted from our active systems and you will no longer be able to access the data.

## Problems, enhancements, feature requests and complaints

### I want to request a new feature or enhancement
We listen to our customers and your Loomio experience today is significantly influenced by people just like you.  New feature request priority is assessed alongside our development roadmap, other customer requests and value to other Loomio users.  Some of our larger customers pay for blocks of developer time to accelerate development of certain features.  This is a good indication of how important the feature is, however we still have to balance this with the needs of all our customers and our market focus.  
Please submit your request via our [Contact form](https://www.loomio.com/contact) and tell us why this is important to you.

### I am experiencing a problem. What should I do?
Software and the internet is constantly changing. We work hard to identify problems before you notice them. However if you do experience a problem please let us know straight away via our [Contact form](https://www.loomio.com/contact).  A screenshot with the url link helps us resolve problems quickly.

### What if I'm not happy with the service
We welcome any and all feedback you may have, and are committed to making Loomio world class. Should you have an issue please do let us know immediately and we’ll be in touch.

### Can I get a refund?
When it comes to refunds, we treat our customers how we ourselves would like to be treated, and assess requests fairly.
[Contact us](https://www.loomio.com/contact) if you would like a refund.
To process a refund, we must receive a request within 30 days of the date payment was made.
