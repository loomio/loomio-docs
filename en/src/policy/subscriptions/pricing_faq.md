# Customer FAQs

## Subscription Plans
### How do I buy a subscription?
Start a Loomio group (if you have not already done so) from this page: [Try Loomio](https://www.loomio.com/try). Your group will start on a 7 day free trial on the service of your choice.

### What support do I get with Loomio Pro?
Our Loomio Pro plan offers a dedicated Loomio expert to help you set up and optimize Loomio for success in your organization. Starting with an initial one hour video call, we schedule regular follow-ups to check in on your needs, introduce new features and offer tips to get the most from Loomio. Pro plan customers receive priority support all year round, to answer questions, help onboard new people and more.

### Can I upgrade to Loomio Pro after purchasing Loomio Starter?
You can upgrade at any time and we will automatically apply a prorated credit for any pre-paid subscription fees.

### Does my organization qualify for the Pro Nonprofit plan?
We love nonprofits and have created a 50% discount on the Loomio Pro plan. 
Nonprofit organizations can upgrade to this plan for immediate subscription to Loomio. We'll then send you an email with a link to validate your organization’s nonprofit status via our partner [TechSoup](https://www.techsoup.org/loomio).

### How do I know if my group qualifies for the Community Lifetime plan?
The Community Lifetime plan is available for community groups and organizations run by volunteers who have no full-time paid staff. 
When you upgrade to this plan we will ask you to make a declaration that your group has no full-time staff.
If you are in doubt, ask “am I being paid by my organization to do this work?” If yes, it’s likely a Loomio Starter or Pro plan is more appropriate for your group. We trust you to make the right decision.  

## Payment
### What payment methods do you accept?
We accept all major credit or debit cards (Visa, Mastercard, American Express). All payments are processed in USD and deducted in the currency of your credit card.
Payment via invoice and bank transfer is available for annual plans. Additional fees may apply.

### Will I have to provide my credit card details up front if I want to start a trial only?
No, we do not require any payment information until you choose to purchase a plan.

### What currency will my credit card be charged in?
Loomio is priced in USD, and the charge applied will be automatically converted to the currency of your card including sales tax, if applicable.

### Will I receive a receipt?
A statement of receipt will automatically be sent to the billing contact email address provided at time of purchase.  You can view billing information in your billing portal.

## Security and data privacy
### Who owns my group’s data?
You do! Unlike some other services, we're not in the advertising business. You are the customer, not the product, and you're in charge. Loomio is open source software, and your data is portable and exportable. You can download your group’s data and open it in a spreadsheet or even export your entire group history to run on your own Loomio server - if you have the skillset, time and resources. 
However you have our promise that we'll run our loomio.com service for our customers until the end of the internet.

### Is my data secure?
Keeping customer data safe and secure is a huge responsibility and a top priority. We work hard to protect our customers from the latest threats. See [Security overview ](https://help.loomio.com/en/policy/security) for details on how we protect your data. Your input and feedback on our security is always appreciated.

### Where are Loomio cloud services hosted?
Our global service at loomio.com is hosted in the USA, operated by Heroku and running on Amazon Web Services data center.

Our regional services loomio.eu run on Amazon Web Services in the Netherlands, and loomio.nz on Amazon Web Services in Australia.

### Why should we trust Loomio?
We've been in business for more than 9 years. We have great relationships with our customers. We're run by a worker-owned cooperative - which means the people who create Loomio also have ownership in it. 

We work with investors who support our social mission, and are committed to ensuring we provide the highest level of privacy and protection for our customer’s data. 

Our software is open source, which means anyone can download and read the code. To the best of our knowledge, we've never had an attacker steal any of our customers' data.

Loomio is based in Aotearoa, New Zealand, ranked by the World Bank and Forbes as the best country in the world to do business, as well as lacking red tape and corruption.

### Do you offer private servers or support for self-hosting?
We can run a private Loomio installation configured to suit your organization, on a server of your choice.  We can also support you with a self-hosted service.  [Talk to us to discuss your needs!](https://www.loomio.com/contact)

### What happens to my data if I stop using Loomio?
If you cancel your plan, your group data will remain available for 30 days. However you will no longer be able to start new threads or invite members to the group.
We recommend that you download everything you want to keep. 
After 30 days from cancellation, your group and all content will be deleted from our active systems and you will no longer be able to access the data.
