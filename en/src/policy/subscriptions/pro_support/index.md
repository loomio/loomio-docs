# Training and support
_Access expert support to help you set up Loomio for success. Working with a Loomio expert introduces you to Loomio key features, helps build a plan to implement and rollout in your organization, and provides coaching support for online facilitation and administration._

## Loomio Pro support
With the purchase of a Loomio Pro plan you will receive a dedicated Loomio expert for any setup and ongoing support you may need.

1. You are invited to a one-hour implementation session to get set up with Loomio for your needs. It’s for you and people who will administer and facilitate Loomio groups in your organization.
 
2. We usually follow up with a further 30 minute to 1 hour session to review progress and help you get the most from Loomio. 

3. During the next 90 days and throughout the year, you are welcome to schedule additional 2-3 sessions as needed to develop collaborative practices online, prepare and review key events (such as a General Assembly) and implement decision-making workflow processes.

Delivery of Pro support is usually via video call (e.g. Zoom), email and within Loomio. Many people find value inviting a Loomio expert to a private thread or subgroup  for questions and answers.

We’ll keep in contact with you about opportunities for how Loomio could work better for you and to introduce new features. 

Pro plan customers receive priority support all year round; to answer questions, help onboard new administrators, and more.

## Group training
Tailored training to suit your organization’s needs.  Our group training starts by understanding your unique group needs, the current tools and processes your group use, so as to implement Loomio in the most useful way.

We then agree to a schedule of 2 x 60 minute online sessions to give your users confidence and mastery in achieving success with Loomio.

As your experience with Loomio builds, 1-2 follow up sessions are scheduled within the next 90 days to lift your use of Loomio and get more out of your tool in your environment.

### The typical package

Scoping. A half-hour session by teleconference (e.g. Zoom) to understand your organization needs in more detail, and map the ecosystem of digital and nondigital tools and processes you currently use to organize, communicate, record, & decide with your group.

Implementation and training workshops to build confidence to introduce Loomio to your group (2 x 60 minute online sessions).  

- The first session is typically for administrators and group coordinators to configure your Loomio group, set up first discussion threads, polls and proposals for initial engagement, and learn how to manage group members.
- The second session can either be to assist you to introduce Loomio to your group users, or to dive deeper into Loomio features that can help administrators. The goal is for attendees to develop confidence and mastery in achieving outcomes with Loomio.

Follow up workshops (one or two 30 minute online sessions), typically scheduled within 90 days. Workshops typically include:

- Review your experience of Loomio thus far, focusing on how well Loomio is integrating with your processes. Responding to questions arising and feedback from group members.
- Adapting and further developing processes and refreshing use of Loomio features (or introducing newly developed features).
- Mapping a path forwards.

Online workshops are usually recorded so a video is made available for your review and to share with people who couldn’t join the workshop.

_Also available:_ In-person workshops for customers in New Zealand and Australia by arrangement. These will be at a location of your choosing and highly tailored to your needs. There may be additional costs with this package, especially for travel, and we’re happy to discuss a plan that makes the most sense for you.
