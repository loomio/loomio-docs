# Consent process

*Seek consent to make a decision. A decision can be made as long as no team member has a valid objection.*

The Consent decision process invites people into decision making towards a solution that is ***"safe to try"***. Focus is on progress over perfection, and consent is reached when there are no valid objections.

Use Consent when you need an inclusive, transparent, collaborative and faster decision.

This guide outlines how you can use the consent process within Loomio to involve your group in decisions.

There are a number of variations in the practice of the consent process. For deeper reading, see the article [Integrative Consent decision making](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consent_process/index.html) co-authored with Round Sky Solutions.
