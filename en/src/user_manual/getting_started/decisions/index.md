Including people in decision-making leads to better decisions, and better outcomes;
- People are well-informed and can exercise their voice,
- More engagement and diverse input strengthens decisions, 
- Sharing power and responsibility builds trust and buy-in, 
- Involving people reduces the decision risk.

## Decision making practices in Loomio

There are many ways to involve people in making decisions. The tools within Loomio are versatile to adapt to most practices.

Many organizations use one or more decision processes, depending on the type of decision, governing policy, values and culture.  

Check out these common decision making processes and how to apply these within Loomio:
 
**[Advice process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/advice_process/index.html)** - Seek advice on a decision you need to make, with the advice of people impacted or who have expertise, so you can make a better decision for your organization.

**[Consent process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consent_process/index.html)** - Seek consent on a decision you need to make, where there are no meaningful objections to your proposal, so you can make a fast decision that is 'safe to try' now.

**[Consensus process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consensus_process/index.html)** - Build consensus for a decision you need to make together, to reach an agreement that satisfies the needs and concerns of all participants.

**[Simple decision process](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/polls/decisions/index.html)** - A simple process to introduce and discuss the decision to be made, listen and sense how people think about it, propose and decide. Start here if you are new to collaborative decision making.
