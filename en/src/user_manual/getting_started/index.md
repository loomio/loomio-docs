Loomio is often used by:

**Boards and Governance** to prepare for meetings, build an agenda, post board papers, vote on resolutions, approve minutes and continue governance between meetings. Helping your board stay in context and better able to respond.

**Member organizations** as a safe, inclusive space for members to share information and raise topics, interact and debate, participate in important decisions and   General Assembly. Including members' voice to organize for action.

**Self-managing teams** to work together, share info and ideas, progress discussions, follow decision making processes and achieve better outcomes. Increasing staff satisfaction and productivity.

Loomio builds a living record of your organization; the decisions made, who was involved and the discussion they had together leading to the decision.
