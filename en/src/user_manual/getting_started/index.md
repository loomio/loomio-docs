Loomio is used by:

**Boards and Governance** to prepare for meetings, build an agenda, post board papers, vote on resolutions, approve minutes and continue governance between meetings. Helping your board stay in context and better able to respond.

See the [Good Governance Guide to Loomio](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/board_processes/index.html) to help you use Loomio in your board or committee. The guide includes examples of threads and polls for common practices.

**Member organizations** as a safe, inclusive space for members to share information and raise topics, interact and debate, participate in important decisions and vote in General Assembly. Including members' voice to organize for action.

**Self-managing teams** to work together, share info and ideas, progress discussions, follow decision making processes and achieve better outcomes. Increasing staff satisfaction and productivity.

Loomio builds a living record of your organization; the decisions made, who was involved and the discussion they had together leading to the decision.
