In a controversial proposal it is common to see mixed results, however this does not mean the proposal has failed.  

Often the new information revealed during the proposal helps form a better proposal that is more likely to pass.

### Outcome

When the proposal closes, the author is prompted to state the **Outcome**.

This is an important final step to record the result of the decision and let everyone know what will happen next.
