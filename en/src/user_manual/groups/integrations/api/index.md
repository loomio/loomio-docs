# Loomio integrations API

As of October 2023 we have a new API. It's very similar to the last API, except it uses normal user accounts rather than per group API keys.

Each user of Loomio has an API key, there is a documentation page that includes working examples of how to use your API key.

It's likely you'll have a user account just for API requests - to ensure that a user account is not invited to polls and discussions, visit the profile page and select "This is a bot account".
