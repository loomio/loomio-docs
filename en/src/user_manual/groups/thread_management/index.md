# Thread management

On the group page there are several tools to help you display and administer threads.

## Pin thread
Group admins can pin a thread to the top of the list of threads to make it easier to find. Pinned threads will appear above your other threads on your group page and are ordered by the most recently pinned item at the top. You can change position of the pinned thread by pinning and unpinning threads.

You can easily  **pin** or **un-pin** from the thread preview options.

## Close thread

To keep the list of discussions on your group page relevant, you can close threads that are no longer active.

Go to the Threads tab on your group page, and open the 3 dot menu (**...**)

To view closed threads, go to the group page and click on the drop-down menu just under the Threads tab. 

Change the thread filter from default **Open** to **Closed**.   You can also use this filter to see **All** threads, **Unread** threads and **Templates**
