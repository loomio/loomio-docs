# Intro to Polls

Polls help you make decisions and progress discussion to an outcome.

- Involve the right people to make better decisions 
- Get engagement, test ideas, listen and sense, identify priorities, and clarify issues, even if the solution might not yet be apparent 
- Set a deadline, prompt people who haven’t participated, and state an outcome
- Flexibly use decision making processes that work for your group

There are many types of decision tools in Loomio and many ways to use them.   

## Proposal

At the heart of Loomio is the proposal.  

A proposal helps convert a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. For example someone suggests a course of action and invites people to respond by voting agree, abstain or disagree. Other proposal options are available to suit common decision-making processes.

As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if the proposal is still open, you can change your response.

In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.

A proposal and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.

## Other poll types

Loomio includes a range of polling tools you can use to support participation and decision making. 

**Sense check**: To ask people for feedback, questions and concerns before moving to a decision.
