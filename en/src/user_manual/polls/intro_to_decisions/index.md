# Proposals and polls

Loomio proposals and polls help you involve people in decisions.  They are used to progress a discussion to an outcome.

- Involve the right people to make better decisions 
- Get engagement, test ideas, listen and sense, identify priorities, and clarify issues, even if the solution might not yet be apparent 
- Set a deadline, prompt people who haven’t participated, and state an outcome
- Apply decision making processes that work for your organization

Loomio includes a series of predefined proposal templates for common decision processes such as; Advice process, Consent process and Consensus. 

The proposal templates are the scaffolding to run a process. You can edit the templates to suit your particular needs, create new templates, or remove and rearrange templates to customize the experience for your organization.

A decision process is usually contained within a Loomio thread and may use one or more proposal templates as you progress towards an outcome. 

See our guides for [Advice process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/advice_process/index.html), [Consent process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consent_process/index.html) and [Consensus process](https://help.loomio.com/en/guides/consensus_process/index.html) for help and examples of using proposal templates at key steps in each process.

### Within a thread

You can start a proposal or poll within a thread to run a decision process or progress a discussion.

**Set up proposal or poll:**
- Give it a title
- Assign a category tag
- Describe the poll question, and how you want people to vote
- Configure poll options
- Set a closing deadline 
- Invite people

In the "Settings" tab you can also set:
- Hide results, until vote is cast or poll closes
- Anonymous voting
- Vote reason to required, optional or disabled
- Reminder that poll is closing soon to nobody, author, undecided voters or all voters

**Running proposal or poll:**
- People vote and add a reason (optional) 
- Results are updated live
- People can change their vote if new info emerges
- A reminder is sent to people who haven’t voted 

**Proposal or poll closed:**
- The proposal or poll closes, and everyone can see the results
- The author sets an outcome, notifying everyone of what will happen next.
