Time poll makes it easy to see everyone's availability and find the best time.

Give your Time poll a title and details. Enter a list of date and time options in your time zone.  

When setting timeslots, consider people in different time zones. Participants will see times localized in their time zone.

Set a meeting duration.

Use Opt-in to seek engagement and encourage participation.  For example think of Opt-in as the online way to ask a room of people *"Raise you hand if ..."*

Like other Loomio polls, Opt-in asks you to set a closing time and will automatically notify people 24 hours before close - encouraging people to participate in a timely way so you can get on with the work.
