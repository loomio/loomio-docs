_Create your own poll type_

![](poll_type_label.png#width-80)

Create a new type of poll for use in your group. Customize terminology and settings so it's easy for other people in your group to run a specific decision making process.

With the new poll type form, you can change voting options, name, description and default duration.

### Voting method

Choose the voting method you want to use.

Show of thumbs is the voting method for Proposal, Sense check and common in Advice and Consent processes.

Other methods include:
- Simple poll - single or multiple choice of options
- Dot vote - allocate a budget of points across a list of options, where people can assign points to options however they like.
- Score poll - people can assign a score on a scale, say 1 to 10 for each option
- Ranked choice - invite people to put options in their order of preference, first to last.

### Poll type name and description

Give the poll type a name and add a description of the purpose of your poll type.

Then give your poll type an example title and details to prompt people using your poll.  The title and details can be edited when used.

### Poll type options

There is a lot of flexibility to configure voting options for your new poll type.

Use the pencil icon alongside the voting option to open the edit modal:

**Option name**: A short name for the option.

**Icon**: Select the icon for the option; thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideway or hand up.

**Meaning**: A sentence that explains what choosing this options means.

**Reason prompt**: A question to prompt voters to provide their reasoning or reconsider their position.  Use the reason prompt to uncover what people like or dislike about the poll. It is also an opportunity to find out what needs to changed to reach agreement.

Notice that as this poll is a template, voting is disabled.

To use the poll template, click **Make a copy**.

When anyone in your group starts a new poll, your new poll template is available for use and included in the list of custom poll types.
