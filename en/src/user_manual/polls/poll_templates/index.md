# Poll templates

*Note, this page is currently being updated with new poll templates. Some descriptions and screenshots may differ from the current software version.*

## Create your own poll template

![](proposal_template_setting.png)

Create a new poll template for use in your organization. Customize terminology and settings so it's easy for other people to run a specific decision making process.

Only group admins can create poll templates.

**Choose the Loomio group for your template**: Poll templates are associated with a particular Loomio group.  (So it's a good idea to create your templates in a group that everyone can access.)  (For example, this could be your Loomio 'parent' group or a special group/subgroup you set up for templates.)

Tip: Invite-only threads can use prposal and poll templates from any group you are a member of.

With the **New poll template** form, you can add a process name, subtitle and introduction.  You can give it an example title to help people using the template, provide default Category tag(s), and provide some example details. You can change voting options, name, meaning and reason prompt.

### Voting method

Choose the voting method you want to use.

Show of thumbs is the voting method for Proposal, Sense check and common in Advice and Consent processes.

Other methods include:
- Simple poll - single or multiple choice of options
- Dot vote - allocate a budget of points across a list of options, where people can assign points to options however they like.
- Score poll - people can assign a score on a scale, say 1 to 10 for each option
- Ranked choice - invite people to put options in their order of preference, first to last.

### Poll type name and description

Give the poll type a name and add a description of the purpose of your poll type.

Then give your poll type an example title and details to prompt people using your poll.  The title and details can be edited when used.

### Poll type options

There is a lot of flexibility to configure voting options for your new poll type.

Use the pencil icon alongside the voting option to open the edit modal:

**Option name**: A short name for the option.

**Icon**: Select the icon for the option; thumbs up, thumbs down, thumbs sideway or hand up.

**Meaning**: A sentence that explains what choosing this options means.

**Reason prompt**: A question to prompt voters to provide their reasoning or reconsider their position.  Use the reason prompt to uncover what people like or dislike about the poll. It is also an opportunity to find out what needs to changed to reach agreement.

Notice that as this poll is a template, voting is disabled.

To use the poll template, click **Make a copy**.

When anyone in your group starts a new poll, your new poll template is available for use and included in the list of custom poll types.
