## Sense check

_Ask for feedback, questions and concerns_

Collaborative decisions include one or more rounds of feedback before a decision is made.

![](sense_check.png#width-80)

The **Sense check** poll is a simple way to get feedback on a decision before things get finalized - clarify and improve an idea before moving to a proposal. 

Sense check lets people know a proposal is forming and encourages them to engage. It is an opportunity to listen to people, sense how they feel and respond appropriately - opening the potential to incorporate their contributions to make a better proposal - that’s more likely to pass.

Use Sense check when you want to survey opinions, rather than advocate for a particular position. It is a great way to surface concerns before moving to a formal agreement.  You can find out if people are happy with where this is going, if they have questions or need more time, or if they are concerned and want something to change.

You can use one or more rounds of ‘Sense check’ to help you co-create a better, more cohesive decision with less stress and anxiety.

## Proposal

_Make a decision together_

The Proposal poll is at the heart of collaborative decisions.

![](proposal_label.png#width-80)

A Proposal is used to present a decision to be made. For example an agreement, document or policy for approval, resolution or appointment.  

Proposal is also used in Advice, Consent and other collaborative decision making processes.

![](proposal_options_new.png#width-80)

## Simple poll

_Find the most popular option_

Before making a decision, find which option(s) people care most about.

![](poll_label.png#width-80)

Simple poll helps you find the most popular option or options with single or multiple choice.

Write any details about the options in the details field, then enter the name of the option and click + to add.

![](poll_options_new.png#width-80)

Set the **Minimum choices** and **Maximum choices** a voter may choose.  Leave the maximum choice as 1 for a single choice poll.

You can use the pencil icon alongside each option to add a meaning, or elaboration, of the option.

![](poll_edit_option.png)

### Settings

As well as the usual Poll Settings, simple poll includes a setting: 

**Shuffle options** allows you to show options in random order, if you are concerned the order of options may bias voting.

![](poll_shuffle_options.png#width-80)

![](poll_vote.png#width-80)

![](poll_results.png#width-80)

![](poll_outcome.png#width-80)

## Time poll

_Find when people are available to meet_

Save time arranging a date for your meeting or event. 

![](timepoll_label.png#width-80)

Time poll makes it easy to see everyone's availability and find the best time.

Give your Time poll a title and details. Enter a list of date and time options in your time zone.  

When setting timeslots, consider people in different time zones. Participants will see times localized in their time zone.

Set a meeting duration.

![](timepoll_options.png#width-80)

### Voting

People mark the timeslots they are available with the green 'thumbs up' icon or leave the red 'thumbs down' in place when unavailable.  They can also use the 'thumbs sideways' icon to say they are available 'if need be'. 

Participants can leave a reason comment to help the organizer find a suitable time.

If the times don't work, participants can suggest alternatives using the message field. You can then update the poll with new times.

![](timepoll_vote.png#width-80)

The results update as voting proceeds in a table showing who is available when, so everyone can see which timeslots are popular.

### Outcome

When the Time poll closes, pick the best time slot and state an Outcome.

![](timepoll_outcome.png#width-80)

**Notify**: Add the people you are inviting to the meeting or event.

**Meeting time**: Click on the meeting time to select the best meeting time.  

**Meeting name**: Give your meeting a name. (Default name is the Time poll title.)

**Location**: You can add a location for the meeting.

**Statement**: State the outcome of the Time poll and any instructions for the meeting.

Loomio will include a calendar invitation with the Outcome notification email, so participants can add to their calendar.

## Opt-in

_Find volunteers or participants_

Use Opt-in to invite people to a join a team, committee or working group, or to participate in an event.  

![](opt_in_label.png#width-80)

‘Opt-in’ has two voting options: Accept or Decline. 

Set how many people you are looking for, say 3 people to join your working group.

![](opt_in_options.png#width-80)

Use Opt-in to seek engagement and encourage participation.  For example think of Opt-in as the online way to ask a room of people *"Raise you hand if ..."*

![](opt_in_results.png#width-80)

Like other Loomio polls, Opt-in asks you to set a closing time and will automatically notify people 24 hours before close - encouraging people to participate in a timely way so you can get on with the work. 


## Score Poll

_Measure the degree of support for each option_

![](score_label.png#width-80)

Use Score poll when you want to survey people for their desire, preference or interest in each option. 

'Anonymous voting' and 'Shuffle options' settings are common for Score poll to reduce any voting bias.

![](score_options.png#width-80)

Participants are asked to evaluate each option and assign a score by moving a slider along a scale.

![](score_voting.png#width-80)

Results are displayed graphically along with a table for each option showing total points, mean points and the number of voters.

![](score_results.png#width-80)

Examples:

* How would you rate your interest in these topics for the next meeting agenda?
* How important are each of these principles to you?
* Which speakers would you like at the next conference?

## Dot vote

_Allocate a budget of points to reveal priorities_

![](dot_vote_label.png#width-80)

This poll type is useful for groups trying to allocate a limited resource to a number of options.  It goes beyond a simple poll by helping participants appreciate there is a constraint when selecting options.

![](dot_vote_options.png#width-80)

Participants are each given a set number of dots.  You decide how many.

![](dot_vote_voting.png#width-80)

They place dots next to options presented that they like.  Participants can place all their dots on a single option or spread over multiple options.  

As participants allocate dots, they may exceed the dot budget limit and so are encouraged to consider how they spend their dots carefully.

![](dot_vote_results.png#width-80)

Options with the most dots “win”.  The results table provides additional data to help you analyse results.
- % of points
- Points
- Mean
- Voters 

Examples:

* Choose strategic priorities for the year ahead.
* Choose agenda items for meeting, conference or General Assembly.
* Allocate spend in a fixed budget.

## Ranked choice

_Understand the ordered preference of options_

![](ranked_choice_label.png#width-80)

Ranked choice is particularly useful when you have a large number of options or holding an election. 

This poll type offers a series of options for people to vote in their preferred order. 

'Anonymous voting' and 'Shuffle options' settings are common for Ranked choice to reduce any voting bias.

![](ranked_choice_options.png#width-80)

You can choose the number of votes people can give and rank. 

![](ranked_choice_voting.png#width-80)

Voters drag and drop options in order of preference (#1 being your most preferred option). 

![](ranked_choice_results.png#width-80)

Results are showed in ranked order. The results table provides additional data to help you analyse results.
- Rank
- % of points
- Points
- Mean

Examples:

* Electing directors to governance board.
* What topics should we focus on at our next conference?
