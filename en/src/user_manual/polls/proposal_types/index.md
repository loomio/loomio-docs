## Simple poll

_Find the most popular option_

Before making a decision, find which option(s) people care most about.

Simple poll helps you find the most popular option or options with single or multiple choice.

Write any details about the options in the details field, then enter the name of the option and click + to add.

Set the **Minimum choices** and **Maximum choices** a voter may choose.  Leave the maximum choice as 1 for a single choice poll.

You can use the pencil icon alongside each option to add a meaning, or elaboration, of the option.

Use Score poll when you want to survey people for their desire, preference or interest in each option. 

'Anonymous voting' and 'Shuffle options' settings are common for Score poll to reduce any voting bias.

![](score_options.png#width-80)

Participants are asked to evaluate each option and assign a score by moving a slider along a scale.

Examples:

* How would you rate your interest in these topics for the next meeting agenda?
* How important are each of these principles to you?
* Which speakers would you like at the next conference?

## Dot vote

_Allocate a budget of points to reveal priorities_

![](dot_vote_label.png#width-80)

This poll type is useful for groups trying to allocate a limited resource to a number of options.  It goes beyond a simple poll by helping participants appreciate there is a constraint when selecting options.

![](dot_vote_options.png#width-80)

Participants are each given a set number of dots.  You decide how many.

![](dot_vote_voting.png#width-80)

They place dots next to options presented that they like.  Participants can place all their dots on a single option or spread over multiple options.  

As participants allocate dots, they may exceed the dot budget limit and so are encouraged to consider how they spend their dots carefully.

Options with the most dots “win”.  The results table provides additional data to help you analyse results.
