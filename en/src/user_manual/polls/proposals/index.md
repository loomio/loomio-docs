# Proposals

*Note, this page is currently being updated with new proposal templates.  Some descriptions and screenshots may differ from the current software version.*

The proposal is the heart of Loomio. A proposal helps convert a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. 

For example, someone suggests a course of action and invites people to respond by voting. As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. If someone contributes some new information or a strong opinion you can change your vote, if you wish.

In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.

A proposal and associated discussion, creates a record of how the decision came about.

Read on to see proposal templates you can use to involve people in decisions.

# Proposal templates

## Question round

Invite clarifying questions to help people understand a proposal.

A Question round is an opportunity for people to ask clarifying questions about the proposal, so that everyone understands the proposal before they say what they think about it.

The Loomio Question round is a special proposal with no voting options. It enables participants to ask questions within a duration you set for the round.

A Question round is commonly used as a step in the Consent process.

## Sense check

Ask for feedback, questions and concerns.

The Sense check proposal is a good way to get feedback, invite questions and uncover concerns. It helps to clarify and improve a proposal before moving to a decision.

Sense check lets people know a proposal is forming and encourages them to engage. It is an opportunity to listen to people, sense how they feel and respond appropriately - opening the potential to incorporate their contributions to make a better decision.

Use the Sense check proposal in the Consent process to invite reactions and comments to improve the proposal, and in a Consensus process to test for consensus.

You can use one or more rounds of ‘Sense check’ to help you co-create a better, more cohesive decision with less stress and anxiety.
