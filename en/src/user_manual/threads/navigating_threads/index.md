## Thread navigation

A typical thread looks like this:

![](thread_navigation.png)

Description of thread features from the top.

**Group name** - At the top left of the thread page is the name of the group or subgroup that the thread belongs to.  Click on this name to go back to the group page.

**Thread privacy** - At the top right of the thread page is a tag showing that this thread is private - only members of the group, and anyone specifically invited to the thread, can see and participate in the thread.  

**Thread title** - The thread title is the largest type font on the page, so easy to spot.  

**Category tags** - The thread may have one or more category tags. Using simple tags helps people more easily find threads of a similar type.

**Thread author** - Under the thread title is see the photo/avatar and name of the person who started the thread.

**Date** - Hover over the date to see the full date and time of thread start.

**Seen by** - Shows who has read the thread, and when.

**Notified** - Shows who has been notified about the thread, and if read or email opened.

**Thread context** - Content to frame the thread.

**Thread interaction and administration tools** - Under thread context is a range of tools where you can watch, invite, react, reply and edit the thread context.  Click on the 3 dot menu (**...**) to see more tools.

**Comments** - Comments are displayed under the thread context. The default display is from oldest to newest. You can change the order of display if you wish, however this applies to everyone in the group.   The comment author, image and date comment added helps you see who has written the comment and when.   Interaction and administration tools are also available for each comment.

**Timeline** - As comments and polls are posted in the thread, a timeline builds marking important milestones in the discussion.  Polls are automatically pinned to the timeline.  Any comment may be pinned to the timeline.

## Thread context

The thread **context** is always found at the top of the thread. Use the context to frame the discussion or decision.

Think of your group as you write content in the thread context.  Your aim is to get a discussion going. So consider what people in your group need to be motivated to participate.  In general, keep the thread context simple and clear.

At the bottom of the context panel is a formatting bar, where you can format text, attach files, images and embed a video. 

![](thread_formatting.png)

As the thread progresses, refresh the context with latest information to help people see current status of the discussion.  Think of the context like a whiteboard in your meeting room, where you can write the agenda, the outcomes intended and how you plan to get there. 

Threads can be edited at any time with the pencil icon **edit**.

## Thread timeline

The thread timeline is on the right of the thread, and helps you quickly access comments and polls in a thread. It is a visual, interactive history building with important comments, polls and thread milestones.

Comments that include a header (H2 or H3), polls and proposals are automatically pinned to the timeline. 

Click on the item in the timeline to go directly to the comment or poll in the thread.

![](thread_timeline_1.png)

Jump to the top of the thread by clicking on "**Context**".

## Comments
The most common activity in a thread is commenting. Comments are visible to anyone who has permission to see the thread.  

### Unread comments 
When you open a thread, Loomio will first show you new comments. 

Unread comments are shown with a yellow line on the left side. 

![](thread_unread_comments.png)

### Writing a comment

You can write a comment in a thread, and people can reply, react or post their own comment to continue the discussion.

When you have written your text, use **Post Comment** to instantly publish the comment. Your comment will be visible to anyone who has permission to see the thread. 

![](comment.png)

The full range of formatting tools described in [Formatting](https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin/index.html) are available for use in comments.

Write your comment and press **Post Comment**.

### Reactions
Reacting to a comment is a great way to encourage and acknowledge a comment by letting the comment author know how you feel.  

It is a quick and light-weight way to participate that does not require any text, nor send an email.

![](reaction.png)

### Replying to a comment

You can reply to someone's comment by clicking on the reply icon located at the bottom right of the comment.

Your reply is published in the thread and an email notification is sent to the author of the comment.

![](comment_reply.png)

You can reply to your own comment so as to nest your reply underneath the comment. Click the three horizontal dots (**⋯**) to find the **reply** feature.

If Loomio has emailed you a comment and says you can reply to the email, you can reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.


### Automatic translation
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZI_ZxJKoiy0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Loomio can translate user content (eg, votes, comments…) from one language into another automatically (with the help of Google Translate). If the author of a comment uses a language other than yours, **Translate comment** will be available in the drop-down options of the comment in question, from the three horizontal dots (**⋯**).

## Interacting with threads

Once a thread is started, a set of tools is available just under the thread context. 

![](thread_interact.png)

### Subscribe

### Invite

Consult an expert or external party while keeping relevant communications all in one place: Invite them to a specific thread by clicking **members**, at the bottom of the thread's context. They won't get access to any other threads in your group, just this one. They do not need to already have a Loomio account, and they can participate by email just like all Loomio users.  _If you_ do _want them to be in the group, then invite them to join from the group page._

You can remove them (or give them permissions) by clicking the dots to the right of their name, again from the context's **members** button.

## Thread display

By default comments in threads are listed one after the other as you scroll down the thread page - oldest comments first.  However you can change the thread order so that newest comments are listed at the top of the thread.  Seeing the latest comments first is useful for threads used for reporting or threads that have been active for some time.

The grey text just under the context will indicate in which order the activity is being listed, along with the number of replies.

To change this setting, click that grey text, choose your preference, and save. _This changes the layout for everyone, not just you._
