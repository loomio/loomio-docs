# Notifying people

Loomio includes tools to help you notify people about activity within Loomio. For example; when you start a new thread discussion, require a response, invite people to take an action or just want to make sure people are alerted to new information.

A notification in Loomio sends an email to the people you notify.  Notifications also appear under the bell icon at the top right of Loomio.

Notification needs vary from group to group, and often vary over time as people become more familiar with Loomio as part of their daily work.  Consider how people in your group want to be notified, and try to strike a balance of letting people know about new activity in Loomio without overwhelming their inbox.

## Notify about new thread

When you start a thread, you can choose to notify all members of a group, or just some of them. Notify sends the thread to specific people via email. 

You can also invite guests to the thread.  Guests can see and participate in the thread, but cannot see other threads in your group that they have not been invited to.

Use the drop down menu to select a group of people, and click on the group to see individual people.  You can remove people from the notification list by clicking the x beside their name.

You can type in the first few letters of the name of a member of your group, and their name in Loomio will appear. Click on this to add to the 'Notify' panel.

You can type or paste in a person's email address.  This is useful to invite a 'guest' to the thread.  Guests can see the thread and all comments and polls within the thread, however they cannot see any other threads of your group.  You can remove a guest from a thread. 

If the person is a member of your Loomio group they will receive the notification as usual.

**Do not notify anyone**

You can also choose not to notify anyone about your thread.  If the thread is started in a Loomio group, then all members of the group will be able to see and participate in the thread.  Members will be alerted that the thread has started through the daily **Catch up summary email** if enabled.

A Loomio thread offers a way for you to share information and work transparently - to "work out loud".  

By not notifying people you are saving a few emails from their in-box, and members of your group can stay informed of progress of the thread through the 'Catch up summary email' or by signing into Loomio. 


## Within a thread

### Mentioning people

If you want to get the attention of a specific person, type **@**, start typing their name, and then select the user name of the person you want to **mention**. You can mention people in comments, threads and polls.

### Replies

When you reply to a comment, you will notify the user you replied to. Find the **reply** button on the bottom of the comment that you want to reply to.

*Note: You can also reply to your comment, but it does not send a notification.  Find the **reply** icon under the 3 dot menu.*

### Reactions

Reacting to a comment is a great way to encourage and acknowledge a comment by letting the comment author know how you feel.  It is a quick and light-weight way to participate that does not require any text, nor send an email.

On any comment or thread's context you can **react** and choose an emoji.

Reactions send a notification within Loomio, but do not send an email.

## Invite to thread

## Notify about thread changes




## Who has seen or been notified about the thread? 

At the top of each thread is **Seen by** and **Notified**.  

These features help you track engagement in a thread or poll.  Although someone may not yet have commented in the thread, you can check to see if they have seen the thread, who has been notified, and if the notification has been read or the email has been opened.
