# Starting threads

## New thread

You can start a thread by clicking **New thread** from a group page. When you start the thread, it will be visible to all members of your group.

Give your thread a title; try to keep it short and to the point. You can always update the title of the thread later.

Use the thread **context** to introduce the topic and frame the conversation or decision to make. Include background information, attach files, link to online documents and embed a video. Let people know what you expect. 

The context will always stay at the top of the thread and you can update it at any time as the discussion progresses.  When the discussion ends, update the context with the outcome.

## Thread privacy
If your group privacy is **Closed** or **Secret** then your threads will be **private**. Private means that only members of the group are able to view the threads started in this group (*except* when you **invite people** such as an expert or any guest not currently part of your group).

If your group is "Open" then all your threads will be public, meaning that anyone with the URL can view the thread.
