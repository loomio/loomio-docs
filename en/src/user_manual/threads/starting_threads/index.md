# Starting threads

## New thread

Start a thread by clicking **New thread** from a group page.

## Set up thread

The thread set up page has two tabs:

- **Content** to write content for your thread.
- **Settings** to configure how the thread displays and mark as template.

### Content tab

**Group:** Check the name of the group is correct.  Anyone in this group will be able to see the thread. You can also start the thread in another group or as an 'Invite-only' thread (no group).

**Tags:**  Add tag(s) to help people find your thread when searching by tag.  Admins can create new tags. 

**Notify:** You can use notify to send the thread to the people you wish.  Use the drop down menu to select a group of people, and click on the group to see individual people.  You can then remove people

**Title:** Give your thread a relevant title.  A thread title is similar to an email subject line.

**Context:** Use thread context to introduce the topic and frame the conversation or decision to make. Include background information, attach files, link to online documents and embed a video. Let people know what you expect. 

The context will always stay at the top of the thread and you can update it at any time as the discussion progresses.  When the discussion ends, update the context with the outcome.

## Thread privacy
If your group privacy is **Closed** or **Secret** then your threads will be **private**. Private means that only members of the group are able to view the threads started in this group (*except* when you **invite people** such as an expert or any guest not currently part of your group).

If your group is "Open" then all your threads will be public, meaning that anyone with the URL can view the thread.
