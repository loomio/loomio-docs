# Troubleshooting
_Common issues and ways to resolve them_

## I can't see any of my groups
To fix this: Sign out then sign in again with the email address you normally use Loomio with.

Why does this happen? This can happen because you participated in a poll when you were not signed in; Loomio creates a guest user, so you can participate without signing in. When you sign in later, we confirm the authenticity of your vote and connect it to your registered user.

## I'm not receiving emails from Loomio
If you cannot find your email code in the email inbox of the account you signed up with – or you started a group and haven't heard from us – **you will likely find it in your spam or junk mail folder.** Then, please white list loomio.com with your email service, or add notifications@loomio.com to your contacts.

## How can I stop my signature being included in email replies to threads?

To be sure that your email signature is not included in your comment when you reply by email, you need to begin your signature with a double hyphen on its own line.

_For example:_

> Best Wishes,<br> \-\-<br>SIGNATURE<br>CONTACT<br>LOGOS ETC

_…emailed in reply to Loomio emails (that invite a reply) will appear as:_

> Best Wishes,
