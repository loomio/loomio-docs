## Create new user account

The first time you visit Loomio you will go through a short process to set up a Loomio user account. 

You won’t need a password and your computer will remember you in future.

**Loomio user accounts are identified by email address** 

You will need to provide an email address to make sure your Loomio user account is yours.

> **Tip**: Use an email address that is uniquely yours, so other group members will easily recognize you and know that your comments are from you.  To avoid confusion, do not use shared and role based email addresses like info@... or ceo@... where more than one person can access the account.

If you have any problem signing in to Loomio, you can always regain access with the email address you used when you set up your Loomio account.

### Invitation via email

You may receive an invitation to join a Loomio group via your email inbox:

## Troubleshooting

### I can't access Loomio
Loomio is a web app, accessible via popular web browsers such as Chrome, MS Edge, Firefox or Safari.  
- Check your browser is updated to a current version for best security and performance.

Sometimes IT systems block untrusted website addresses.  Loomio is open source software and does not download any software to your computer or device.  
- Check your IT system is not blocking [loomio.com](https://www.loomio.com/) and [loomio.com](https://loomio.com/) domains.  
  - If you are on the European service: [loomio.eu](https://loomio.eu/)
  - If you are on the Aus/NZ service: [loomio.nz](https://loomio.nz/)
- IT may need to unblock access to Loomio, and add loomio.com to their ‘allow list’ or ‘white list’.

### I can't receive emails from Loomio
Loomio uses your email address for user authentication.  Notifications of new threads, decisions and other activity in Loomio are sent to your email address.
- Check your IT system is not blocking emails from @loomio.com 
- IT may need to unblock emails from Loomio and add @loomio.com to their ‘allow list’ or ‘white list’.
- If IT refuses to budge, can you use a personal email address?

### I can't see any of my groups!
To fix this: Sign out then sign in again with the email address you normally use Loomio with.

Why does this happen? This can happen because you participated in a poll when you were not signed in; Loomio creates a guest user, so you can participate without signing in. When you sign in later, we confirm the authenticity of your vote and connect it to your registered user.
