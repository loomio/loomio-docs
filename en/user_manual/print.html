<p>Loomio is a decision making tool for collaborative organizations.</p>
<p>It enables you to bring people together, have discussions, make proposals and achieve clear outcomes.</p>
<p>It's a discussion forum with a set of tools to allow you to facilitate a discussion towards an outcome, for example proposal and polls.</p>

</div>
<p>Loomio is often used for:</p>
<p><strong>Boards and Governance</strong> to prepare for meetings, build and agree agenda, post board papers, vote on resolutions, approve minutes and make decisions between meetings.</p>
<p><strong>Member organizations</strong> to share information and raise topics, seek input and advice,  enable members to participate in important decisions, and include more members in a General Assembly.</p>
<p><strong>Self-organizing teams</strong> to work together in structured decision making processes, share info and ideas, progress discussions, make proposals and achieve better outcomes.</p>
<p>Loomio builds a living record of your organization; the decisions made, who was involved and the discussion they had together leading to the decision. </p>
<h2 id="how-loomio-works"><a class="header" href="#how-loomio-works">How Loomio works</a></h2>
<p>Loomio is a simple structure of three main elements; Group, Thread and Decisions. </p>
<h3 id="group"><a class="header" href="#group">Group</a></h3>
<p>A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/Groups.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><strong>Group home</strong></p>
<p>Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help group members participate.</p>
<h3 id="thread"><a class="header" href="#thread">Thread</a></h3>
<p>Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/Threads.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>Threads are used for many purposes; to prepare for a meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on proposals, approve actions, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a shared understanding of important issues.</p>
<p>Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organization’s discussions and decisions.</p>
<h3 id="decisions"><a class="header" href="#decisions">Decisions</a></h3>
<p>One of the best things about Loomio is its range of tools to progress a discussion to an outcome. Each tool has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. </p>
<p><img src="getting_started/Proposals.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>A <strong>proposal</strong> is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask group members to either:</p>
<ul>
<li>agree</li>
<li>abstain or </li>
<li>disagree. </li>
</ul>
<p>Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. </p>
<p>A proposal, and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>
<h3 id="other-voting-tools"><a class="header" href="#other-voting-tools">Other voting tools</a></h3>
<p>A proposal is good for suggesting a particular path and gauging who wants to take it. But sometimes you might want group members to make a different kind of choice. </p>
<p>Loomio offers a range of other poll tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Poll</strong>: to ask people which option/s they approve</li>
<li><strong>Check</strong>: think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'</li>
<li><strong>Time poll</strong>: to find the best time for the group to do something</li>
<li><strong>Score poll</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale</li>
<li><strong>Dot vote</strong>: to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out</li>
<li><strong>Ranked choice</strong>: to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="putting-it-all-together"><a class="header" href="#putting-it-all-together">Putting it all together</a></h2>
<p><img src="getting_started/key-concept.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Use your own group or <a href="https://loomio.org/try">start a demo group</a>.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="signing-in-to-loomio"><a class="header" href="#signing-in-to-loomio">Signing in to Loomio</a></h1>
<p>The first time you visit Loomio you will go through a short process to set up a Loomio user account. </p>
<p>You won’t need a password and your computer will remember you in future.</p>
<p><strong>Loomio user accounts are identified by email address</strong> </p>
<p>You will need to provide an email address to make sure your Loomio user account is yours.</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Tip</strong>: Use an email address that is uniquely yours, so fellow group members will easily recognize you and know that your comments are from you.  To avoid confusion, do not use shared and role based email addresses like info@... or ceo@... where more than one person can access the account.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>If you have any problem signing in to Loomio, you can always regain access with the email address you used when you set up your Loomio account.</p>
<p><strong>Invitation via email</strong></p>
<p>You may receive an invitation to join a Loomio group via your email inbox:</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/invitation.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>Accept invitation</strong> button at the centre of the email.</p>
<p>The link will take you to the internet browser on your computer, tablet or smartphone and open a page where you are invited to create an account.</p>
<p>On your computer you will see:</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/sign-in.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>CONTINUE WITH EMAIL</strong> button at the centre of the screen.</p>
<p>You will be taken to this page to create your Loomio user account.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/create-account.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<p>Type in your name, so people in your group will recognise you.</p>
<p>Click the <strong>CREATE ACCOUNT</strong> button at the bottom right hand corner of the screen.</p>
<p>A Loomio user account will then be created for you.</p>
<h2 id="upload-profile-photo-optional"><a class="header" href="#upload-profile-photo-optional">Upload profile photo (Optional)</a></h2>
<p>You can add a picture of yourself, to display next to all the comments you make. That makes it easy for other group members to see who said what.</p>

<p>Lets take an orientation tour to help you quickly understand how to participate in discussions and decisions in your group.</p>
<h2 id="group-page"><a class="header" href="#group-page">Group page</a></h2>
<p>Your group home page is the first place people see when they arrive. It contains a description of why the group exists, what you will use it for, and any other information that may help you participate.</p>
<p>You can add an image that represents something of your organization and place.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/group-page-threadview.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="tabs"><a class="header" href="#tabs">Tabs</a></h3>
<p>Under the group description you will see tabs. Clicking on each tab displays information about:</p>

<p><strong>Settings</strong> - Where administrators of the group can set and change group privacy and member permissions.</p>
<p>Below the tabs there is a search bar, with filters such as open or closed threads and category tags. The filters help you view a reduced set of information.</p>
<p>If the threads tab is selected, the thread list shows the title of the thread, author, number of replies, and when last active.</p>
<h2 id="sidebar"><a class="header" href="#sidebar">Sidebar</a></h2>
<p>The sidebar menu is accessible from the (☰) menu icon at screen top left, where you can see:</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/sidebar-menu.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dashboard</strong> - Open Polls and Proposals and recently active Threads.</li>
<li><strong>Unread threads</strong> - A list of Threads you have yet to read.</li>
<li><strong>Invite-only threads</strong> - Private Threads that do not belong to a group.</li>
<li><strong>Start a new thread</strong> - Where you can start a new private Thread. </li>
<li><strong>Your Loomio groups</strong> - Where you can easily find your Loomio groups and subgroups.</li>

<p>The bell icon in the top-right is where notifications are accessed within Loomio.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/notifications.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="email-notifications"><a class="header" href="#email-notifications">Email notifications</a></h3>
<p>Loomio sends emails to keep you updated on the activity in your groups. </p>
<p>Emails Loomio may send you include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Mention and Replies</strong> - When someone @mentions you in a comment or replies to you, you will receive a notification email.</li>
<li><strong>Subscribe on participation</strong> - If selected, when you participate in a thread you will receive emails for all further activity. Not recommended for most people.</li>
<li><strong>Catch-up summary email</strong> - The 'Yesterday on Loomio' email includes activity from all your groups and threads that you have not read yet.</li>
<li><strong>Invitations to threads, polls and proposals</strong> - You may receive an email when invited to a new thread, poll or proposal.</li>
<li><strong>Reminders and Outcomes</strong> - If you have not voted in a poll or proposal, you may receive a reminder 24 hours before close. You may also receive an email stating the outcome of a poll or proposal.</li>
</ul>
<p>These emails are to help you participate effectively with your group. The default settings are to help you stay up to date with activity on Loomio but should not overload your email inbox.</p>
<p>If you are receiving too many emails from Loomio, you can change the default email settings. Talk to your group administrator to get the balance right for you.</p>
<p><img src="getting_started/profile.png#width-50" alt="" /></p>
<p><img src="getting_started/email-settings.png#width-80" alt="" /></p>

<p>It’s a container where group members can find and share information, participate in important discussions and decisions that affect their work.</p>
<p>A Loomio group looks like this.  At the top of the page you will see an image and logo that you can tailor to represent your organization.  This allows people arriving into your group to see they have joined a place they recognize and feel welcome - a safe space where people feel they can come and participate.</p>
<p><img src="groups/intro_to_groups/group_page_2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Choose a representative name for your group and use the group description to outline;</p>

<p>If you are new to Loomio, you can start a group on a free trial at any time from the <a href="https://www.loomio.com/">Loomio website</a>.</p>
<p>For many organizations, a single Loomio group is sufficient. You can start as many subgroups as you need within the group. See <a href="https://help.loomio.com/en/user_manual/groups/subgroups/index.html">Subgroups</a> for more info.</p>
<p>If you already use Loomio and would like to start a new group for another organization or purpose, you can do this from the sidebar menu - click on <strong>New group</strong>.</p>
<p>A new Loomio group starts a new free trial and you will be invited to upgrade the trial to a paid subscription.</p>
<p>Pro plan customers have more than one group included with the Pro subscription. <a href="https://www.loomio.org/contact">Contact us</a> to connect your new group to your Pro plan subscription.</p>

<ul>
<li>The purpose of the group. </li>
<li>The work you are going to do.</li>
<li>What you hope to achieve.</li>

<p><em>We use Loomio to discuss and make decisions about issues, work priorities and plans, prepare for meetings, and collaborate on strategic documents.</em></p>
<p><em>We need a safe and private space for discussion, to share knowledge, perspective and wisdom, and to help us make good decisions together. Loomio will help us stay up to date, be involved and work together more effectively to achieve our objectives.</em></p>

<p><img src="groups/settings/settings-privacy.png#width-90" alt="" /></p>
<p>Your privacy settings determine who can find your group, who can see the threads in your group, and how people join.</p>
<p>The recommended privacy setting for new groups is <strong>Secret</strong>. This means everything is private to those invited members of the group. No one will know about this group (or subgroup) unless you invite them.</p>
<p>If you want the content of your discussions and decisions to be public, change your group privacy to <strong>Open</strong>. The members list will only be visible to other members.</p>
<p>Many groups use <strong>Closed</strong> to allow people to find the group and request to join. The <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>Group description</strong> are publicly accessible in Closed groups.</p>
<p>Open groups may contain secret and closed subgroups.</p>
<p>A member of an open group can see the closed subgroup but not the secret ones.</p>

<h2 id="thread-view-settings"><a class="header" href="#thread-view-settings">Thread view settings</a></h2>
<p>Thread <strong>activity</strong> is comprised of all the comments, replies, proposals, polls, votes and other notable things that happen within the thread. You can alter how that activity is displayed in order to optimize the experience for your group. These settings change the default layout for everyone in your group, but can be adjusted for each thread to serve  a specific purpose:</p>

<h3 id="flat-or-nested-replies"><a class="header" href="#flat-or-nested-replies">Flat or Nested replies</a></h3>
<p>The thread can also be set to display chronologically, as a <strong>flat list</strong>, where all activity is displayed in the order that it happened, or as <strong>nested replies</strong> of one or two levels. </p>
<p>Nested replies keeps replies to comments together, and is very helpful to easily see mini-discussions within an overall thread.</p>

<p><em>How to invite people and manage group membership.</em></p>
<p>Inviting people to join your Loomio group is a critical step to success - however everyone is busy; many people are reluctant to try a new tool and can be slow to respond to your invitation.</p>
<p>Loomio includes tools to help you invite people; but you may also need to reach out to members by phone, text, chat or in a meeting, to tell them <em><strong>why</strong></em> you are using Loomio. If your group members resonate with this, it will encourage them to give it a go.</p>
<p>For example, your group might need:</p>
<ul>
<li>a safe space where members can find all the info they need and participate in their own time</li>
<li>to stay in touch and respond to issues that come up between meetings </li>
<li>to progress discussions and make decisions as needed</li>
<li>to have better meetings and focus precious meeting time on issues that matter</li>
</ul>
<p>If you're still having trouble with people not accepting your invitation: </p>
<ul>
<li><a href="groups/membership/index.html#re-send-invitations">Re-send your invitation</a>.</li>
<li>Invite them to a particular thread or poll using their email address (so they can see that things are happening). Their email reply or vote will appear in Loomio.</li>
<li>Record a short video of yourself on your phone, Zoom or Loom and send this with your invitation; so people can see that you're a real person, the importance of the work, your enthusiasm and passion, and to encourage them to join in :-)</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="invite-people"><a class="header" href="#invite-people">Invite people</a></h2>
<p>Go to your group page and click the <strong>Members</strong> tab to access member management</p>
<p>You can <strong>Invite</strong> particular people to your group with their email address or <strong>Share</strong> a link to your group via email, newsletter, chat or from your website.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RGv0Yq6sv8g?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h2 id="invite-people-via-their-email"><a class="header" href="#invite-people-via-their-email">Invite people via their email</a></h2>
<p>Click <strong>Invite</strong> on the Member tab of your group page to send an email invitation with a <em>single-use</em> link to a person's email address.  The recipient is invited to create a Loomio user account and join your group.</p>
<p>If the recipient already has a Loomio user account they can still accept the invitation to join your group with their existing account.</p>
<p><img src="groups/membership/invite_member.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="allow-people-to-request-to-join"><a class="header" href="#allow-people-to-request-to-join">Allow people to &quot;Request to Join&quot;</a></h3>
<p>If your group's privacy is <strong>closed</strong> then you can share your group URL ie: <code>www.loomio.org/group-name</code>. When people arrive at your group page, they will see the group title and description, and a button <strong>Join group</strong> where they can request membership. Group admins will receive an email where you can approve or deny the request to join.</p>
<h3 id="invite-many-at-once"><a class="header" href="#invite-many-at-once">Invite many at once</a></h3>
<p>You can send invitations by email to up to 100 people at a time by entering (or copy/pasting) multiple email addresses into the &quot;Who would you like to invite&quot; box. Separate email addresses by comma or space. </p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Tip</strong>: Copy email addresses from a column in a Google or Excel spreadsheet, and paste into the invitation box.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you submit the form (ie, click <strong>Send</strong>) an email will be sent to each of the email addresses you supplied, containing a unique invitation link that can only be used once. This email will be sent in your current language.</p>
<h3 id="invite-people-to-subgroups"><a class="header" href="#invite-people-to-subgroups">Invite people to Subgroups</a></h3>
<p>You will follow the same process as above.</p>
<p>You can invite people to a 'parent' group, and one or more subgroups simultaneously when you invite them with the <strong>Invite people</strong> button. Tick the boxes next to the subgroups you want them to immediately be a part of when they join the group. See it demonstrated in the video clip <a href="groups/membership/index.html#inviting-people">just above</a>.</p>
<h3 id="encourage-people-to-particiapte"><a class="header" href="#encourage-people-to-particiapte">Encourage people to particiapte</a></h3>
<p>If people join but don't begin to participate right away, you might like to welcome them to the group with an @mention, for example:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Welcome to the group @Jane :) It's great to have you here! Would you saying a little bit about your work in this space?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h2 id="managing-invitations"><a class="header" href="#managing-invitations">Managing invitations</a></h2>
<p>To manage invitations, open the filter/ drop down from the Members tab of your Group page and select <strong>Invitations</strong>; click on the three dot menu to the right of the member invitation.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BH0x494sZlU?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>You can also make people administrators or set their title (eg, &quot;IT Support&quot;) within the group before they accept their invitation.</p>
<h3 id="re-send-invitations"><a class="header" href="#re-send-invitations">Re-send invitations</a></h3>
<p>Follow up on people who don't make it into the group and give them a nudge. If someone has lost or forgotten about their invitation email, you can re-send it from the dropdown menu beside their name on the Members page.</p>
<p>Click on the three dots (<strong>⋮</strong>) next to the person you want to resend the invitation to, and then choose <strong>Resend invitation</strong>. </p>

<p><img src="groups/membership/members_tab_1.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="admin"><a class="header" href="#admin">Admin</a></h2>
<p>There are only two user types in a Loomio group; <strong>member</strong> and <strong>admin</strong>. </p>
<p>Admins perform administrative tasks for your group including; add and remove members, grant and remove admin permissions, change group privacy and member permission settings, upgrade and manage subscription plans.</p>
<p>The person creating a new Loomio group is made admin by default. We recommend to make at least one other person in your group admin, to insure someone can always administer your group. </p>
<p>Admins are people you trust to administer your group. You can have as many admins in your group as you wish.</p>
<p>To make a member <strong>admin</strong>, go to the Members tab, find the member and click on the three dots (<strong>⋮</strong>) next to their name. Choose <strong>Make admin</strong>. An <code>Admin</code> tag will appear beside their name.</p>
<p><img src="groups/membership/make_admin.png" alt="Selecting make admin from the membership dropdown menu" /></p>
<h3 id="managing-subgroups"><a class="header" href="#managing-subgroups">Managing subgroups</a></h3>
<p>If you are the admin of a parent group, or organization, you have additional permissions with regards to any <strong>closed</strong> subgroups.</p>
<p>You will be able to join any closed subgroup by clicking the &quot;Join Group&quot; button on the left of the Subgroup page in question (just under the tabs).</p>
<p><img src="groups/membership/join_group_button.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Once you have joined the subgroup, you will also be able to make yourself the admin of that subgroup, just as you would promote anyone to admin (<a href="groups/membership/management.html#admin">see above</a>).</p>
<p><em><strong>Note:</strong></em> <em>these permissions do not extend to</em> <em><strong>secret</strong></em> <em>subgroups.</em></p>
<h3 id="removing-group-members"><a class="header" href="#removing-group-members">Removing group members</a></h3>
<p>When you click <strong>Remove from group</strong> you'll be asked to confirm the removal. Upon removal, this user will no longer have access to the group's pages, threads, polls, or proposals. They will receive no further emails or notifications of group activity. However, any comments and votes written by the user will remain untouched.</p>
<p><img src="groups/membership/remove_from_group.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>After you have removed someone from the group, you can add them back to the group later if you wish.</p>
<h3 id="leaving-a-group"><a class="header" href="#leaving-a-group">Leaving a group</a></h3>
<p>To leave a group go to the Group page's <strong>Settings</strong> tab and click <strong>Leave group</strong>.</p>
<p><img src="groups/membership/leave_group.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="assigning-titles"><a class="header" href="#assigning-titles">Assigning titles</a></h3>
<p>You can name the role someone has within the group, or identify which organization they represent using the <strong>title</strong> feature. You or an admin can change yours by clicking <strong>set title</strong> from the dropdown near your name in the desired group's Members tab.
<img width="1119" alt="image" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/486367/115946965-c520ee80-a518-11eb-9212-5c3236a4e05b.png"></p>
<p>You can even have different titles in different subgroups.</p>
<h2 id="membership-requests"><a class="header" href="#membership-requests">Membership requests</a></h2>
<p>If your group's <a href="groups/membership/../settings/#advanced-settings">advanced settings</a> allow people to join your group <strong>by request</strong>, an admin will need to approve each membership request. Group coordinators will receive an email each time there is a new membership request. The link in the notification email will take you to the <strong>Requests</strong> page, where you can approve or decline the request.</p>
<p>To find pending requests for memberships, navigate to the Members tab of your Group page and click the <strong>Requests</strong> button on the right.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="category-tags-1"><a class="header" href="#category-tags-1">Category Tags</a></h1>
<p>Category tags make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic.</p>

<p><img src="groups/tags/tags_view.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Tags can be applied when starting or editing a Thread, Poll or Proposal.</p>

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="subgroups"><a class="header" href="#subgroups">Subgroups</a></h1>
<p><em>Subgroups help you organize in teams.</em></p>
<p>Subgroups help you organize your communications and members so that the right people are engaged in their work together.</p>
<p>For example, you can use subgroups for your organization's</p>
<ul>
<li>governance board</li>
<li>working team or a project working group</li>
<li>a topic (such as 'strategy' or 'learning')</li>
</ul>
<p>Unlike tags, subgroups create a separate space for a specific group of people. <a href="groups/subgroups//en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin/#using-category-tags">Tags</a> are a way to organize your threads. Subgroups allows you to change the permissions, notifications, and more for a set of threads and people.</p>
<p>Subgroups work just like groups do, but are located within your group/organization, which we call the &quot;parent group&quot;. Most of the features and settings are the same as what you encounter in your parent group. This also means that someone can be part of your subgroup (eg, your board) but not your parent group.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-subgroup"><a class="header" href="#add-a-subgroup">Add a subgroup</a></h2>
<p>To add a subgroup in your group, go to the <strong>Subgroups</strong> tab.</p>
<p><img src="groups/subgroups/subgroups_tab.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click the <strong>New subgroup</strong> button, give it a meaningful title and decide on the desired <a href="groups/subgroups//en/guides/getting_started/starting_a_group/#privacy">privacy</a>) setting, and click <strong>Start subgroup</strong>. You can now start threads and invite people in.</p>
<p>However, similar to <a href="groups/subgroups//en/guides/getting_started/starting_a_group">starting a group</a>, you may want to 'prepare the space,' so to speak, for those you will soon invite. A group description, and adjusting any settings including the banner image, can help people feel comfortable in the Loomio group and with the others who will be participating here. Again, this supports psychological safety – proven to improve performance.</p>

<p>The <a href="groups/subgroups//en/guides/getting_started/starting_a_group/#privacy">privacy</a> settings for subgroups follow the same logic as that of any group. A <strong>secret subgroup</strong> will not be visible to group members who are not invited to the subgroup.</p>
<p><strong>Closed subgroups</strong> will be listed in the Subgroups tab of the relevant parent group, and, by default, members of the parent group can request and – upon approval by an admin – join them.</p>

<h3 id="permissions-1"><a class="header" href="#permissions-1">Permissions</a></h3>
<p>Subgroups can operate independently of the main group. For example, if the subgroup privacy setting is set to <strong>Secret</strong>, then only invited members can find this subgroup, see who is in it, and see threads.</p>
<p>Subgroups can have their own coordinators, and, thus, the coordinators of a subgroup may not be the same as the coordinators of the parent group.</p>
<p>Any coordinator of the parent group may independently make themselves coordinator of any subgroups therein.</p>
<h3 id="privacy-1"><a class="header" href="#privacy-1">Privacy</a></h3>
<p><strong>Closed</strong> subgroups have an additional <strong>Advanced setting</strong> that allow members of its parent group to see private threads, or not.</p>

<p>If you answered yes, then you probably will find subgroups useful.</p>
<p>Subgroups help if you want to…</p>
<ul>
<li>Keep a conversation private to a smaller number of people in your group</li>
<li>Keep people from being bothered by conversations that don't matter to them; <em>bonus: subgroups have their own <a href="groups/subgroups//en/user_manual/users/email_settings">notification settings</a></em></li>

<p>Threads are where you discuss topics.  Group members respond in the thread by posting comments and replies. Threads can also contain polls and proposals to help progress a discussion to an outcome.  As people comment in the thread and vote in polls, the thread timeline builds so you can easily find key milestones.</p>
<p>Here are some examples of topics you might use in threads:</p>
<ul>
<li>Draft and approve a strategic document</li>
<li>Plan and deliver an event</li>
<li>Seek advice and prepare a recommendation to stakeholders</li>
<li>Submit a proposal to a customer, or to seek funding</li>

<p>The context will always stay at the top of the thread and you can update it at any time as the discussion progresses.  When the discussion ends, update the context with the outcome.</p>
<h2 id="thread-privacy"><a class="header" href="#thread-privacy">Thread privacy</a></h2>
<p>If your group privacy is <strong>Closed</strong> or <strong>Secret</strong> then your threads will be <strong>private</strong>. Private means that only members of the group are able to view the threads started in this group (<em>except</em> when you <strong>invite people</strong> such as an expert or any guest not currently part of your group).</p>
<p><img src="threads/starting_threads/thread_private.png" alt="" /></p>

<p><em>Catalyze interactions.</em></p>
<p>Effective use of Loomio means knowing how and when to get attention from the group, group members, and even external people your group wants to engage in Loomio to keep everything in one place.</p>
<p>If you ask for attention when it's really important, and avoid it when it's not, people will keep paying attention.</p>
<h2 id="within-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#within-a-thread">Within a thread</a></h2>
<h3 id="mentioning-people"><a class="header" href="#mentioning-people">Mentioning people</a></h3>
<p>If you want to get the attention of a specific person, type <strong>@</strong>, start typing their name, and then select the user you want to <strong>mention</strong>. Click post or start. You can mention people in comments, threads, or even decisions. They will be notified that you’ve mentioned them.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VzM1AWnNP7c?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<h3 id="replies"><a class="header" href="#replies">Replies</a></h3>
<p>When you reply to a comment, you will notify the user you replied to. Find the <strong>reply</strong> button on the bottom of the comment to which you wish to associate your reply (it will indented or nested under the comment you replied to, by default).</p>
<p><img src="threads/notifying_people/reply.png" alt="where to click reply on a comment" /></p>
<p><em>Note: You can also <a href="threads/notifying_people/../engaging_with_threads/#comments-and-replies">reply to yourself</a>, but it does not send a notification.</em></p>
<h3 id="reactions-1"><a class="header" href="#reactions-1">Reactions</a></h3>
<p>On any comment or thread's context you can <strong><a href="threads/notifying_people//en/user_manual/threads/engaging_with_threads/#reactions">react</a></strong> to quickly respond with an apt emoji.</p>
<p>Reactions send a notification within Loomio, but do not send an email.</p>
<h3 id="start-a-decision"><a class="header" href="#start-a-decision">Start a decision</a></h3>
<p>The most powerful way to get attention from your group. Ensure that you have a clear decision description so people know how to participate. Loomio will notify everyone you choose (the whole group, everyone in the thread, or selected individuals) about new decisions, <em>although you can choose not to notify people and let them find it on their own time.</em></p>
<h2 id="starting-a-thread"><a class="header" href="#starting-a-thread">Starting a thread</a></h2>
<h3 id="notify"><a class="header" href="#notify">Notify</a></h3>
<p>When you start a discussion, you can choose to select all members of a group, or a select number of them. When you select the whole group, you can assume it will get everyone's attention. People you invite will get a notification immediately.</p>
<p>You can also invite guests now (or later, as described just below).</p>
<h3 id="invite-people-1"><a class="header" href="#invite-people-1">Invite People</a></h3>
<p>When you start a thread, your whole group can access it immediately. If you want more people's participation, or want their participation sooner, you can additionally send them an alert via the box that immediately appears when you start the thread. You can also alert people in this way later on via the <strong><a href="threads/notifying_people//en/user_manual/threads/thread_admin/#invite-guests-to-thread">members</a></strong> button at the thread context's bottom. Exactly like <strong>notify</strong>, invited parties will immediately receive a notification.</p>
<p>If, for example, the thread is an important announcement and contains information that's ready for the whole group to take notice of, then <strong>notify</strong> them when you start the thread.</p>
<p><em><strong>Tip:</strong></em> <em>We've made it quick to select all of the members of the relevant group; click the link with your group's name.</em></p>
<p>Use <strong>invite people</strong> to invite guests or experts from outside your group to a specific thread; <a href="threads/notifying_people/../thread_admin/#invite-guests-to-thread">learn more</a>.</p>
<h3 id="notify-the-right-people-every-time"><a class="header" href="#notify-the-right-people-every-time">Notify the right people every time</a></h3>
<p>Subgroups are a great way to make it simple to send notifications to a specific set of people. If I click <strong>invite people</strong> from a thread in a subgroup, I can simply select <strong>Members of <code>Subgroup Name</code></strong>.</p>
<p>It's great to remind your working group when there hasn't been much interaction with a thread. To increase the chances of good engagement, check that the <a href="threads/notifying_people//en/guides/getting_started/having_discussions/#keep-the-topic-concise">thread context and title include a clear invitation</a>, specifying how to participate.</p>

<h2 id="thread-context-1"><a class="header" href="#thread-context-1">Thread context</a></h2>
<p>The thread <strong>context</strong> has special status within a thread. It's always at the top, and it's always visible on the page.</p>
<p><img src="threads/engaging_with_threads/context_panel.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Like a comment, you can format your text and attach files or images. Unlike a comment, anyone in the group can update the context (and the title of the thread) by default. This means you can enable anyone to pitch in and help keep things easy to understand and easy to find.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Tip:</strong> As the thread grows, update the context with key understandings and information so new people can catch up and participate easily.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The context is like the whiteboard in your meeting room, where you can write the agenda, the hopeful outcomes and how you aim to get there, and take group notes. <em>Learn more about preparing threads and groups for success <a href="threads/engaging_with_threads//en/facilitators_guide">in our Facilitator's Guide</a>.</em></p>

<h3 id="link-to-a-google-doc"><a class="header" href="#link-to-a-google-doc">Link to a Google doc</a></h3>
<p>You can add a link to a Google doc in Loomio anywhere there is a text space; when starting a thread or poll, writing a comment, or updating your group description. The link icon is one of the formatting tools under the space you can write text in Loomio.</p>
<p>To use the link feature, </p>
<ol>
<li>Select the text you want to link to - say the name of a document</li>
<li>Click the link icon</li>
<li>Find the document link - go to your Google drive and ‘Get link’, or go to the Google doc and ‘Share link’.  Check the link permissions so members can open the link - usually ‘Anyone with the link’. Copy the link to your clipboard.</li>
<li>Now, go back to Loomio and paste the link.</li>
</ol>
<p>A preview of the doc will appear under the text space. You can remove this if you want.</p>
<p>Now, anyone with access to your Loomio thread and permission to view the doc can open and read it.</p>

<p>You can embed a video from popular video platforms like Youtube and Vimeo into Loomio anywhere there is a text space; when starting a thread or poll, writing a comment, or updating your group description. The embed video icon is one of the formatting tools, under the space where you write text in Loomio.</p>
<p>To use the embed video feature, </p>
<ol>
<li>Click the embed video icon</li>
<li>Go to the video you want to embed, find and copy the shareable link </li>
<li>Now, go back to Loomio and paste the link</li>

<p><strong>Tip:</strong> Make sure you set the visibility of the video in Youtube or Vimeo so that the people you want to can view it. In Youtube 'Unlisted' is a good option if you do not want to make the video public.</p>
<h3 id="markdown"><a class="header" href="#markdown">Markdown</a></h3>

<h2 id="comments-and-replies"><a class="header" href="#comments-and-replies">Comments and replies</a></h2>
<p>The most common activity in a thread is commenting. Comments are shared with everyone in the thread – usually this is just the members of your group. First look for <strong>Comment</strong> and your user photo (or initials).</p>
<p><img src="threads/engaging_with_threads/comments_and_facilitation_box.png" alt="" />
<em>Make sure that Comment is highlighted, not Proposal or Poll.</em></p>
<p>Write your comment and press <strong>Post</strong> to have your say.</p>
<p>Replies are like comments except in that the author of the original comment will be notified of your reply. Click <strong>reply</strong> on the comment you would like to associate your comment with, as it will be nested underneath theirs – by default – in the thread in which you replied.</p>
<p>You can reply to your <em>own</em> comment in order to nest your reply underneath the comment. Click the three horizontal dots (<strong>⋯</strong>) to find <strong>reply</strong> in this case.</p>
<p>If Loomio has emailed you a comment and says you can reply to the email, you can reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.</p>
<h2 id="editing-comments"><a class="header" href="#editing-comments">Editing comments</a></h2>
<p>If you've made a typo, or want to add a bit more information to your comment shortly after you've posted it, click <strong>edit</strong> on your comment. Editing does not take anyone else's attention with notifications nor unread signals.</p>
<p><img src="threads/engaging_with_threads/edit_comment.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Changes you've made will be visible <em>to others</em> via the <strong>edited</strong> button, so you can see what people have changed in their comment.</p>

<p><img src="threads/engaging_with_threads/comment_history_modal.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you have new information or are coming back after an extended period of time, just make a new comment, then people who have already read your comment will see that there is new information.</p>
<h2 id="reactions-2"><a class="header" href="#reactions-2">Reactions</a></h2>
<p><img src="threads/engaging_with_threads/reactions.png" alt="" />
Click <strong>react</strong> on any thread context or comment to share how a comment made you feel, or acknowledge something someone has said, without writing a comment. They're a light-weight way to participate without interrupting the conversation, and they only send a notification within the app (not by email).</p>

There are a selection of <strong>facilitation tools</strong> and <strong>decision tools</strong> available to you from within the thread.</p>
<ul>
<li>Proposals are there to help you see if there is agreement about a statement or course of action, and surface the disagreement if that's what needs to happen. Often, you can use proposals to bring the discussion to conclusion.</li>
<li>Polls are useful to understand preferences of the group.</li>
<li>Use a time poll if you need to get everyone together, and want to find the best time for that meeting to happen.</li>

<p>Tasks are a new feature of Loomio. The intention is to add support within threads to name and assign actions (or tasks) to people, and track their progress.</p>
<h2 id="add-a-task"><a class="header" href="#add-a-task">Add a task</a></h2>
<p>When you are writing a comment or thread on Loomio click the &quot;Task list&quot; button from the text editor toolbar to add a task.</p>

<h2 id="name-and-assign-the-task-to-a-person"><a class="header" href="#name-and-assign-the-task-to-a-person">Name and assign the task to a person</a></h2>
<p>From here you can name the task, assign someone with the standard @mention feature, and even set a due date with a reminder notification.
<img src="threads/thread_admin/tasklist2.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>When you have assigned task to someone, or a task is assigned to you, the task will appear on your Tasks page so you can easily keep track of the tasks you’re responsible for.</p>
<p><img src="threads/thread_admin/task_list.png" alt="" /></p>
<h2 id="set-a-reminder"><a class="header" href="#set-a-reminder">Set a reminder</a></h2>
<p>If you click &quot;Add due date&quot;, you'll be asked when the task is due, and when to send a reminder to person assigned to the task. The &quot;Task due&quot; notification is sent via email.</p>

<p><em>Turn a conversation into an action.</em></p>
<p>Loomio includes a number of tools to help you progress a discussion to an outcome. </p>
<p>A proposal is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask group members to agree, abstain or disagree.  Other proposal options are available to suit common decision-making processes.</p>
<p>As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if the proposal is still open, you can change your response.</p>
<p>In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.</p>
<p>A proposal and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.</p>
<h2 id="polling-tools"><a class="header" href="#polling-tools">Polling tools</a></h2>
<p><strong>Poll:</strong> to ask people which option/s they approve.</p>
<p><strong>Check:</strong> think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'</p>
<p><strong>Time poll:</strong> to find the best time for the group meet.</p>
<p><strong>Score poll:</strong> to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale.</p>
<p><strong>Dot vote:</strong> to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out.</p>
<p><strong>Ranked choice:</strong> to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/O-laa4di8kI" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>There are a number of <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../starting_proposals">types of proposals</a>, but the basics remain the same for all of them.</p>
<h2 id="step-by-step-for-all-decision-tools"><a class="header" href="#step-by-step-for-all-decision-tools">Step-by-step for all decision tools</a></h2>
<ol>
<li>You choose to use a poll or proposal (within a thread)</li>
<li>You name it, describe the question or proposal it represents, and set its duration</li>
<li>You notify group members (typically all, but you may select none or specific...)</li>
<li>Group members participate and share a tweet-length message with their selection</li>
<li>They can change their minds as understanding develops; live results are available</li>
<li>A reminder is sent out the day before closing</li>
<li>The poll closes, and everyone can see the results</li>
<li>The author sets an <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../outcomes">outcome</a>, notifying everyone of what will happen next.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="title-and-details"><a class="header" href="#title-and-details">Title and Details</a></h2>
<p><strong>Writing proposals</strong></p>
<p>Include enough details so everyone knows what it means to agree or disagree.</p>
<p>Avoid combining a range of ideas in one proposal, because people might agree to some aspects but not others and be unsure how to respond. You can break complex decisions down into multiple proposals.</p>
<p>When making a proposal, state your expectations and describe the impact the proposal will have if adopted. If it's a formal or binding proposal it's often worth describing what a 'disagree' or 'block' means.</p>
<p>You might want to explore a few <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../proposal_types/#ways-of-using-proposals">ways of using proposals</a>, for some guidance and inspiration.</p>
<h2 id="attachments"><a class="header" href="#attachments">Attachments</a></h2>
<p>You can attach files to decisions using the paperclip icon, just underneath the details form. You will be prompted to select a file from your device.</p>
<h2 id="dates-and-duration"><a class="header" href="#dates-and-duration">Dates and Duration</a></h2>
<p>When you choose a <strong>Closing time</strong>, Loomio will let you know the length of time in which participants will be able to participate in the proposal or poll. During this window, people can submit their position or choice and leave a reason, and they can also edit these if they think on it again or receive new information or ideas, perhaps from others' votes.</p>
<p>Consider how the proposal closing time will affect engagement from your group members, and choose accordingly. You might want to time the proposal so it closes before a meeting, or avoid closing over a weekend.</p>
<p>Beyond considerations of inclusion (enough time) and urgency (deadlines), you may want to give additional consideration to the date and time the poll closes, as Loomio will send a reminder <code>24 hours</code> before it closes. You can sometimes improve engagement if your group members receive this at a time when they can respond right away.</p>
<p>You can extend the deadline of an open proposal. This can be a good idea if engagement is active and people are working through the issue, or if engagement has been sparse and you'd like to prompt more participation before concluding. To do so, edit the poll or proposal to change the closing time.</p>
<h2 id="invite-members"><a class="header" href="#invite-members">Invite Members</a></h2>
<p>It's good to let people know when you're taking a poll or a vote. After you start your proposal you will see a box allowing you to <strong>Invite to vote</strong>, where you will have the opportunity to select <strong>Members of group</strong> or <strong>Members of thread</strong>, or input the names of some of your group. You can select all and then remove some people from the list. This will send a notification to all those listed.</p>
<p><img src="polls/starting_proposals/invite_people_to_vote_modal.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="invite-guests-or-experts"><a class="header" href="#invite-guests-or-experts">Invite guests or experts</a></h3>
<p>Similar to the <strong>invite people</strong> feature, if you input the email of someone outside your group in the <strong>invite people to vote</strong> form they will be given permission to participate in <em>only</em> that proposal or poll; <em>however</em>, they will be able to see the <em>whole</em> thread in which their participation has been invited (but <em>not</em> any of the group's content beyond that). They will not be able to comment or participate in other proposals or polls even though they can see those that are in the same thread.</p>
<h3 id="reopen"><a class="header" href="#reopen">Reopen</a></h3>
<p>If a poll closes earlier than what is ideal for your group arriving to a clear shared outcome, you might want to <strong>reopen</strong> it, setting a new closing time.</p>
<p><img src="polls/starting_proposals/reopen.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="close"><a class="header" href="#close">Close</a></h3>
<p>Similarly, if you no longer need to let the poll or proposal continue, you can choose <strong>close</strong> to end it before its closing date. Don't forget to <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../outcomes">set an outcome</a> so everyone is clear on where you got to and/or what's next!</p>
<h2 id="proposal-options"><a class="header" href="#proposal-options">Proposal options</a></h2>
<p>There are some universal options that apply to most of the proposals and polls that Loomio offers. If you're interested in a specific tool's options (eg, the time poll's <strong>if need be</strong> option) see the section on the relevant tool… <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../proposal_types">→ Types of proposals and polls</a></p>
<h3 id="anonymous-voting"><a class="header" href="#anonymous-voting">Anonymous voting</a></h3>
<p>If you tick the <strong>Anonymous voters</strong> box, participant information will not be recorded with each response. This means that you will never know who chose which positions or shared which responses.</p>
<p>You can be certain the box was ticked by you, or the person who started it, when you see the text, &quot;<strong>Votes are anonymous</strong>&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="notify-me-when-people-participate"><a class="header" href="#notify-me-when-people-participate">Notify me when people participate</a></h3>
<p>When selected, you will be notified whenever someone participates – within the app, and by email (by default).</p>
<h3 id="voters-may-add-options"><a class="header" href="#voters-may-add-options">Voters may add options</a></h3>
<p>For all polls except the <strong>Count</strong>. When selected, participants may add their own options when voting.</p>
<p>When users add options the person who created the poll will be notified.</p>
<h3 id="hide-results-until-closed"><a class="header" href="#hide-results-until-closed">Hide results until closed</a></h3>
<p>Select this option if you want results to be hidden until the poll or proposal closes.</p>
<img src="polls/starting_proposals/results_hidden_until_closed_option.png" class=border-orange width=300px height=auto>
<p>The poll will appear as below until the poll closes.</p>
<img src="polls/starting_proposals/results_hidden_until_closed.png" class=border-orange>
<p>Once the poll is closed, you will see the results and be invited to leave an <a href="polls/starting_proposals/../outcomes">outcome</a> as normal.</p>
<h2 id="export-poll"><a class="header" href="#export-poll">Export poll</a></h2>
<p>Export the stances and outcome of a poll as a spreadsheet (.csv) file. Click the three horizontal dots (<strong>⋯</strong>) at the bottom of the poll or proposal – you will find it to the right of <strong>invite people to vote</strong> – and click <strong>Export</strong>.</p>

<p>Don't hesitate to start a proposal just because you're not sure everyone will agree - proposals are not only for when you have consensus, they're designed to surface issues that need resolving and are useful for clarifying disagreements.

<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="polls-and-proposals"><a class="header" href="#polls-and-proposals">Polls and Proposals</a></h1>
<p><em>Loomio's <strong>proposals</strong> and <strong>polls</strong> are desgined to help you move a discussion through to clear outcomes</em></p>
<p>There are a number of different types of polls. Below the thread context, switch from the <strong>Comment</strong> box to the <strong>Poll</strong> to see the variety of unique ways to get your group's input and/or visualise where the group stands on a given topic or question.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/3l100CM.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The <strong>Proposal</strong> tool also has a variety of options that allow you to run a number of distinct processes (eg, a 'questions &amp; comments round'), as covered <a href="polls/proposal_types/index.html#proposals">below</a>.</p>
<h2 id="time-poll"><a class="header" href="#time-poll">Time poll</a></h2>
<p><em>Find a time to meet</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/cmde9LX.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Time poll makes it easy to identify when is the best time to meet.</p>
<p>Enter a selection of times and share the poll with the people involved. Participants tick the times they can attend and the result is a table showing who is available when, so you're able to pick the best time for the group.</p>
<p>So that you can arrange calls with people in other parts of the world, Loomio adjusts times so they are correct when displayed for each participant.</p>
<p>When you are selecting your times, Loomio will display your team’s most used time zones so you can quickly propose times that suit most members.</p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/M9L6byc.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>If the times don't work, participants can suggest alternatives using the message field. You can then update the poll with new times.</p>
<h2 id="check"><a class="header" href="#check">Check</a></h2>
<p><em>Count how many people have completed a task, or ask for volunteers</em></p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types/check.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Make an offer or ask people to take some action. Think of it as the online equivalent of asking a room of people &quot;Please raise your hand if you…&quot;.</p>
<p>There are many ways you can use a check, but only one or two ways to respond: a Tick (✔), meaning affirmative, or an X mark (✘) meaning no or unsure.</p>
<p>You can choose to use just one or the other if that makes more sense; <em>eg, it may not help to receive</em> <em><strong>No</strong></em> <em>responses for an opt-in or volunteer opportunity, in which case you will select the</em> <em><strong>Yes</strong></em> <em>option only</em></p>
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/b28F7mciATA?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
<p>Other examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>I've checked my contact details are correct</li>
<li>I've read the document and left my feedback</li>
<li>I'm coming to the event</li>
<li>I'll join the working group.</li>
</ul>
<p>A benefit of Count is that it automatically notifies those people who forget to participate, giving people a little encouragement to get the job done.</p>
<h2 id="poll"><a class="header" href="#poll">Poll</a></h2>
<p><em>Measure popularity or offer a choice</em></p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types/poll.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Enter a question and provide some options for people to choose from. People vote for one or more options - depending on if you allow single or multiple choice.</p>
<p>Write any details about the options all together in the details field, then just enter the name of the option in each poll option field.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>Where should we have our Christmas party?</li>
<li>Which catering company should we use?</li>
<li>What size t-shirt would you like?</li>
<li>If we ran a workshop, how likely are you to attend?</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="multiple-choice"><a class="header" href="#multiple-choice">Multiple choice</a></h3>
<p>Select the tick box, <strong>Multiple choice</strong>, if you wish for people to be able to choose multiple options rather than just a single choice off of the list of options.</p>
<h2 id="score-poll"><a class="header" href="#score-poll">Score Poll</a></h2>
<p><em>Express the degree of preference for each option</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/kLXKujG.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>The score poll is commonly used for general surveys or 'temperature checks', in which electing a single 'winning' option is not necessarily the point.</p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types/score_poll_results.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>People get to express their desire, preference or interest in each option. The poll produces more granular results than a simple majority vote.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>How would you rate your interest in these topics for the next meeting agenda?</li>
<li>How important is each of these principles to you when considering our team vision?</li>
<li>How much would you like to see each of the following speakers at the next conference?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="dot-vote"><a class="header" href="#dot-vote">Dot vote</a></h2>
<p><em>Prioritise options together by allocating a 'budget' of points</em></p>
<p>This style of poll is useful for groups trying to allocate a limited resource (even time) to a number of options (eg, agenda items, or budget line-items)</p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types/dot-vote.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Everyone gets a number of dots to allocate against a set of options to represent their priorities. This can build a more detailed picture than a simple poll.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>You're given $100 to spend on the business; how would you spend it?</li>
</ul>
<p>See <a href="http://dotmocracy.org/">dotmocracy.org</a> for more tips and resources about this voting method.</p>
<h2 id="ranked-choice"><a class="header" href="#ranked-choice">Ranked choice</a></h2>
<p><em>Rank options in the order of preference.</em></p>
<p><img src="https://i.imgur.com/4zU6t7Z.jpg" alt="" /></p>
<p>Offers a series of options for people to vote in their preferred order. You can choose the number of votes people can give and rank. This decision-making type allows people to express their opinion in more detail than traditional polls.</p>
<p>Ranked choice is particularly useful when you have a large number of options or an election setting, where you are concerned with two somewhat similar options 'stealing' votes from one another, resulting in a less popular option gaining the plurality.</p>
<p>Examples:</p>
<ul>
<li>What would you like to eat at the company summer party?</li>
<li>Who should be our next deputy mayor?</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="proposals"><a class="header" href="#proposals">Proposals</a></h2>
<p><em>Seek collective agreement</em></p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types/proposal.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Proposals are great for bringing a discussion to a clear outcome, developing or adopting policy, approving applications, and making decisions with input from others.</p>
<p>With good participation, a proposal creates support within the group to take action.</p>
<p>Participants can indicate their <strong>position</strong> and give a statement to explain why they chose it.</p>
<h3 id="change-which-positions-can-be-submitted"><a class="header" href="#change-which-positions-can-be-submitted">Change which positions can be submitted</a></h3>
<p>You can change the positions, or options, that proposal participants will have to choose from. There are several configurations for you to choose from.</p>
<p><img src="polls/proposal_types//en/user_manual/whats_new_loomio_2/flexible_proposals1.png" alt="" /></p>
<p><em>For example,</em> you might decide to take a period of time for 'questions &amp; comments' before you ask people to respond to the final proposal. In this case, you may even choose to have <strong>No voting</strong>. While you could invite questions &amp; comments without a proposal, the proposal can be a useful way to create a very clear time box and invitation to comment on <em>this</em> proposal. Using a proposal for questions &amp; comments can also help remind people to participate with the notification sends 24 hours before the poll closes.</p>
<p><em>Another example:</em> If your group doesn't use a variant of <a href="polls/proposal_types//en/guides/consent_process/#glossary">consent-based decision making</a> then you may choose to use a configuration without the &quot;block&quot; or &quot;objection&quot;.</p>
<h3 id="ways-of-using-proposals"><a class="header" href="#ways-of-using-proposals">Ways of using proposals</a></h3>
<p>Don't hesitate to start a proposal just because you're not sure everyone will agree - proposals are not only for when you have consensus, they're designed to surface issues that need resolving and are useful for clarifying disagreements.</p>
<h4 id="uncover-the-controversy"><a class="header" href="#uncover-the-controversy">Uncover the controversy</a></h4>
<p><em>E.g. Let's put a bike stand next to the front desk</em></p>
<p>If there are two or more competing ideas, propose supporting one. Controversial topics might require a series of proposals to build shared understanding.</p>
<h4 id="series-of-small-yess"><a class="header" href="#series-of-small-yess">Series of small Yes's</a></h4>
<p><em>E.g. We host the conference; dates and venue to be confirmed later</em></p>
<p>Break down a complex issue into smaller parts and agree on them piece by piece.</p>
<h4 id="polarising-minority"><a class="header" href="#polarising-minority">Polarising Minority</a></h4>
<p><em>E.g. Share our pay rates publicly</em></p>
<p>Sometimes loud voices can seem like they are representing more of the group than they really are. Raise a proposal to put their views in perspective.</p>
<h4 id="temperature-check"><a class="header" href="#temperature-check">Temperature Check</a></h4>
<p><em>E.g. Temperature Check: we should change the privacy policy</em></p>
<p>A temperature check is a way to test how the group feels without concluding a fully realized proposal. Use it when you want to survey opinions, or test a hunch, rather than advocate for a particular position.</p>
<h4 id="on-disagreement"><a class="header" href="#on-disagreement">On disagreement</a></h4>
<p>'Disagree' and 'block' are often controversial positions to take. We encourage you to see them as opportunities to understand where communication has been inadequate, points of view are under-represented, or as a source of valuable insight.</p>
<p>If things feel tense on a personal level, we recommend that you talk (one-on-one) with the person to hear their concerns.</p>
<div style="break-before: page; page-break-before: always;"></div><h1 id="outcomes"><a class="header" href="#outcomes">Outcomes</a></h1>
<p><em>Record your decisions and share what's next by setting outcomes.</em></p>
<p>When your proposal closes, you’ll be prompted to set a proposal outcome.</p>
<p>In Loomio, it's not assumed that majority wins - the outcome or conclusion of a decision is up to you to define on behalf of the group. Sometimes it makes sense to go with the majority, but sometimes even one dissenting voice means it's a no.</p>
<center><img src="polls/outcomes/share_outcome.png" alt="" width="80%"></center>
<p>Group members can be notified of the <em>outcome</em>—see how in the screenshot below—so it's a very useful tool for keeping people in the loop. You can clearly define next steps and name specific actions, or summarize what was learned from the process.</p>
<p>To give a poll or proposal some closure with <strong>Share outcome</strong>, click on the decision in <em>Previous decisions</em> or from the <em>Decisions</em> page, or when prompted.</p>
<br>
**Example outcomes**:
<blockquote>
<p><em>This proposal did not reach consensus because several people were concerned about budget impacts. George and Jimena will do some financial modelling and raise a new proposal next week.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>or</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I've taken on board everyone's input. As the project manager, this is my call to make and I've decided we are going to extend the timeline by 10 days.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<br>
Setting outcomes makes your decision archive easy to search, because you have a succinct statement for each proposal.
<p>After you select <strong>Share outcome</strong>, you will have the ability to alert group members and/or voters as depicted below.</p>
<center><img src="polls/outcomes/share_outcome_notification.png" alt="" width="80%"></center>
<p>You can always click on the <strong>X</strong>, if you are happy for people to encounter the outcome on their own time. Outcomes, like comments, will cause a thread to indicate it is unread.</p>

<h2 id="user-accounts-are-identified-by-email-address"><a class="header" href="#user-accounts-are-identified-by-email-address">User accounts are identified by email address</a></h2>
<p>Loomio user accounts are identified by an email address. If you sign in via a third party such as Google, we'll use the email address of your Google account.</p>
<p>This means you can login via email even if you login via a third party to begin with.</p>
<h2 id="creating-a-new-user-account"><a class="header" href="#creating-a-new-user-account">Creating a new user account</a></h2>
<p>It's recommended to sign in via Google or Facebook (if you use those services) because for most people it's faster, more secure, and less complex than using a password. Another benefit is that you won't need to manually upload a profile photo. Loomio does not read other information from your sign in provider (see our <a href="https://www.loomio.org/privacy">privacy policy</a>).</p>

<p>If you don't want to check your email to sign in, you can easily set a password. To do this, take the same steps you would to <a href="users/sign_in/../user_profile/#resetting-your-password">change your password</a>.</p>
<h3 id="dont-create-more-than-one-user-account"><a class="header" href="#dont-create-more-than-one-user-account">Don't create more than one user account</a></h3>
<p>Remember to use the same email address each time you login, or you may end up with two user accounts, which will cause permission errors when you're checking notifications.</p>
<p>Sometimes people think they need two Loomio accounts because they have two groups and they want to keep things separated; However, Loomio is designed to support belonging to multiple groups with one user account.</p>
<h4 id="merging-user-accounts"><a class="header" href="#merging-user-accounts">Merging user accounts</a></h4>
<p>If you do find yourself with more than one user account, you can <a href="users/sign_in/../merge_accounts">merge them</a>.</p>

<p>Invitations are not tied to the email they are sent to. If someone sends you an invitation to an email address other than the one you use for your Loomio user account, you do not need to create a new user account or get the invitation re-sent.</p>
<p>Just click the invitation link and replace the text in the email form with the email address you would like to use, or the email address of your existing account, as you proceed.</p>

<p>After creating an account via a third party (eg: Google), you can still sign in with email. Just enter the email address associated with your Google account into the Email address field and <strong>Sign in with email</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="linking-a-third-party-to-an-existing-user-account"><a class="header" href="#linking-a-third-party-to-an-existing-user-account">Linking a third party to an existing user account</a></h3>
<p>If you want to sign in with a third party (eg: Google) but you already have a Loomio account with another email address, you can link your accounts. To do this, just sign in via your preferred third party, Loomio will recognize it's your first time using that sign-in method. Enter the email address of your existing account and <strong>Link accounts</strong> when you have the choice between this (don't click <strong>Create account</strong>).</p>

<h3 id="i-cant-see-any-of-my-groups"><a class="header" href="#i-cant-see-any-of-my-groups">I can't see any of my groups!</a></h3>
<p>To fix this: Sign out then sign in again with the email address you normally use Loomio with.</p>
<p>Why does this happen? This can happen because you participated in a poll when you were not signed in; Loomio creates a guest user, so you can participate without signing in. When you sign in later, we confirm the authenticity of your vote and connect it to your registered user.</p>

<h2 id="emails"><a class="header" href="#emails">Emails</a></h2>
<p>Loomio sends emails to keep you updated on the activity in your groups. The default settings assume that you don't have a habit of using Loomio regularly so are designed to ensure you can stay up to date by checking your emails.</p>
<p>Emails we send out include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>A daily summary called <strong>Yesterday on Loomio</strong>. This includes activity from all your groups and threads, but only content which you have not read yet.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Mention</strong> and <strong>Reply</strong> notifications. If someone replies to a comment you wrote, or they write a comment and mention you in it, you'll get an email with what they wrote.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Invitations to threads and notification of polls or proposals. If someone wants to notify the group about a new decision or discussion thread, they can select everyone or just some people in the group to notify. Also be aware of <strong>poll closing soon</strong> and <strong>outcome</strong> notifications.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Thread updates. If <strong>subscribe on participation</strong> is checked, then after you comment or vote within a thread, you'll be emailed any further activity.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>For any thread-specific email (that's most except the Yesterday on Loomio email) you can reply directly from your email and your replies will be posted into the Loomio thread.</p>

<p>The <strong>Recent threads</strong> page gives you an overview of the most recent activity happening in your groups. You can access this page via the sidebar. If you are a member of multiple groups, the Recent threads page will be your landing page when you sign into Loomio <em>unless you are only a member of a single group.</em></p>
<p>The Recent Threads page displays content from your groups in an ordered list. Open proposals are at the top, followed by all of the threads from your groups, sorted by most recent activity (Today, Yesterday, This week, This month, Older than a month).</p>
<p>If a thread or proposal title is highlighted with a yellow line along its left border, then new activity has taken place since you last visited and this thread is considered <strong>unread</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="unread-threads"><a class="header" href="#unread-threads">Unread threads</a></h2>
<p>The <strong>Unread threads</strong> page shows all threads and proposals that have new content since you last visited, sorted by group. You can access this page via the sidebar. You can clear unread items without reading them by hovering over the thread preview and clicking <strong>mark as read</strong>.</p>
<h2 id="group-pages"><a class="header" href="#group-pages">Group pages</a></h2>
<p>Because Loomio is a place for your group, we have designed the <strong>Group page</strong> to be the hub and dashboard for your group.</p>
<p>Group pages are where you start threads, where most of the action happens.</p>
<p><img src="users/navigation/new_thread.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>By default, your group page lists all of the open threads in your group. You can use the thread filter on the left to show…</p>
<ul>
<li>threads that are archived or <a href="users/navigation/../../threads/thread_admin/#close-thread">closed</a></li>
<li>only the unread threads</li>
<li>all of the threads, open or closed.</li>
</ul>
<p><img src="users/navigation/../../threads/thread_admin/sort_threads_on_group_page.png" alt="" /></p>
<h3 id="category-tags-help-you-sort-threads"><a class="header" href="#category-tags-help-you-sort-threads">Category Tags help you sort threads</a></h3>
<p>View all the threads that belong to a category by using the other thread filter. These options are created when people <a href="users/navigation/../../threads/thread_admin/#category-tags">tag threads</a>.</p>
<p><img src="users/navigation/sort_by_category.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>You can also access this filtered view from within any tagged thread; simply click the tag (the category you're interested in) from the thread's <a href="users/navigation/../../threads/navigating_threads/#finding-the-right-thread">page</a>.</p>
<p>You can always select <strong>All tags</strong> to exit the filtered view you accessed by choosing a tag from the filter menu.</p>

<p>Loomio can send notifications to your chatroom!</p>
<p>Chat tools and Loomio work well together. Chat is like an open or 1:1 conversation in your office, and Loomio is like getting people together in a meeting room to discuss a particular topic and make a decision. </p>
<p>Loomio supports Slack, Discord, Microsoft Teams, Matrix and Mattermost.</p>
<p>You can send notifications to your chatroom any time you like, just the same way you would invite individual people to vote, or to join a thread.</p>
<p>You can also configure notifications to always happen when a specific event happens, like someone starting a thread.</p>
<h2 id="what-it-looks-like-in-chat"><a class="header" href="#what-it-looks-like-in-chat">What it looks like in chat</a></h2>

<h2 id="generate-a-webhook-url"><a class="header" href="#generate-a-webhook-url">Generate a Webhook URL</a></h2>
<p>We've prepared step by step walk-throughs for each service we support. Follow the right one for your service to obtain the webhook URL you'll need to add the chatbot in Loomio.</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="groups/integrations/chatbots/../slack/">Slack</a></li>
<li><a href="groups/integrations/chatbots/../microsoft_teams/">Microsoft Teams</a></li>
<li><a href="groups/integrations/chatbots/../discord/">Discord</a></li>
<li><a href="groups/integrations/chatbots/../matrix/">Matrix</a></li>
<li><a href="groups/integrations/chatbots/../mattermost/">Mattermost</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Our webhook based system can also be used to support other systems that support incoming webhooks with either HTML or Markdown formatting. This could be something like Zapier or Rocketchat.
Just select the mattermost bot, but use a custom webhook URL.</p>
<h2 id="how-to-setup-a-chatbot"><a class="header" href="#how-to-setup-a-chatbot">How to setup a chatbot</a></h2>
<p>After configuring your chosen service (see above), you'll have a webhook URL.
Open the chatbot settings to pop it into a new chatbot for your group.</p>

<p>You probably don't want to click any of the checkboxes for now. Just enter the name (such as &quot;Discord #general&quot;) and the URL and click the save button at the bottom of the form.</p>
<p><img src="groups/integrations/chatbots/loomio-chatbot-form.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>If you decide later on you want the chatbot to be notified every time something happens, you can come back and check some boxes.</p>
<h3 id="invite-to-poll"><a class="header" href="#invite-to-poll">Invite to poll</a></h3>
<p>This is how to send a notification to your chatroom inviting people to vote in a proposal.
It's the same process for Share outcome, Invite to thread, Remind to vote, Poll edited etc.</p>

<hr />
<p>Open your Discord server and find the server settings menu.
<img src="groups/integrations/discord/server-settings.png" alt="" /></p>
<p>Click &quot;Integrations&quot;

<p>Loomio can send notifications into your Matrix channels when new discussions, proposals, comments, votes, and outcomes occur. </p>
<p>Matrix is nice because it allows some HTML in the chatroom, and Loomio takes advantage of this.</p>
<p>Our Matrix integration is a little different to our other chat integrations - it does not use a webhook - we've built a custom bot client for this one.</p>
<p>You will need to create a matrix user for the bot to login as.</p>
<p>Once you've created a user for the bot, sign in at that user to obtain the following information.</p>
<p>We're using Element for this guide.</p>
