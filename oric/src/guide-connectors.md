# For connectors

‘Connectors’ have special access and responsibilities in Loomio. Typically, a corporation’s connector is the person who provides administrative support to the board of directors.

Your connector’s primary objective is to **set up your Loomio group to work for your circumstances**. Your connector will also ***connect*** and exchange information—with:
* all the **directors** on their board—to ensure they can access and use the tools
* other corporations’ **connectors**—for comparing notes on using Loomio
* **Loomio**—for technical support
* **ORIC**—for any discussion of the ORIC–Loomio ‘Connected Governance’ project.

This part of the guide firstly invites you to assess how well-prepared your directors are for connected governance. Then it describes 6 concrete steps you can take to introduce your directors to your Loomio group and get them using it.

To galvanise you for the work, here’s a reminder of the benefits your corporation can reap when directors invest their time and energy in connected governance:

**Benefits of connected governance**

The board will own a secure, private space for its business and processes.
* Every director can see who said what, when.
* Every director can contribute in their own time.
* The board can do routine tasks online to free up time in meetings for discussions that matter.
* Polls offer directors a powerful way to gain a wholeboard perspective.
* When directors disagree, they can see where and why, and work to build consensus.

**Purpose: To set up Loomio effectively for your board.**

Our aim is to encourage directors to join and participate in your Loomio group. They should be easily able to:
* Sign in to Loomio ( decisions.oric.gov.au )
* Read and comment on threads
* Vote in polls and proposals
* See how your governance practices work in Loomio

**Using this Guide**

There are a series of steps to the guide. Work through these or navigate to a section using the table of contents.  Reach out to [Loomio support](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact) for further help if needed.

# Are your directors ready for connected governance?

**Technology & digital literacy**

Connected governance requires directors to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet. They must be capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, reading digital documents and viewing and hearing videos.

Check that each director has all of the following:

- [x] an **up-to-date device**—a computer, tablet or smart phone with email and a modern internet browser
- [x] **internet service** via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)
- [x] **capability** to send and receive email, browse the internet, download documents and play videos.

If a director lacks capability in some areas, is there a person in the corporation—or a friend or family member—who can support them?

Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old out-of-date browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer may not work.

If you have a problem using Loomio on your device, [Contact Loomio support](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact).

# 1. Adjust group settings for the board

## Group settings

Your Loomio group comes pre-configured to help you get started. As a connector you have administrative rights for the group.  This means you can edit group settings.

Please review each of the following settings and make whatever changes will best suit your corporation.

*On your group home page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit group settings**.*

You will land in the settings for your group’s Profile, where you can adjust the following:

**Group name**: The name of your corporation is the default. Make it your own.

**Handle**: A simplified label for your group that becomes part of the web address for it. Tip short is good!

**Cover image**: Upload an image that represents your corporation. *(Replace the stock image.)*

**Logo**: Upload your logo to appear alongside your group name when people visit your group.

![](group_settings.png#width-80)

**Group Description**: The group description is the first place people see when they arrive into your Loomio group. Write it to help new directors to understand the purpose of the group and the work you will do together. Provide any other information that orients people and encourages them to participate.

A template description for your group is provided. You can edit or replace with your own text, upload or link to any relevant documents. A wide range of formatting tools are available to help you, including:

* **Attach files**: Use the paper clip icon to attach files from your computer. *(Find this just below the group description box.)*
* **Insert link**: Go to the internet page you want to link to, copy the link to your clipboard. Highlight the text that you want to link. Click Insert link and paste the link and click ***Apply***.

**An example of a group description**

![](group-description-template-1.png#width-80)

Once you’re happy with the group profile, check the other tabs for PRIVACY, PERMISSIONS and THREADS. You are free to make any changes you wish but the following suggestions may help.

## Other Group settings

**Privacy** 

Check your group privacy is set to **Secret**. That means people will only know the group exists if they have been invited to it.

![](group_privacy.png#width-80)

**Permissions**

As group administrator you can modify what members of your group are allowed to do.  Permissions are initially set to balance safety and freedom to use the main features of Loomio.

![](group_permissions.png#width-80)

## Tags

Use tags to make it easy to find threads of a particular type or on a particular topic.

Your Loomio group is pre-configured with the following tags.

*Admin, AGM, Board meeting, Report, Finance, Legal, Members, Minutes, Planning, Policy, Resolution, Rule book, General meeting, Strategy, Template.*

On the ***Threads*** page there is a dropdown arrow to see your tags.

![](view_tags.png#width-80)

You can create and apply tags when you start or edit a ***thread***, ***poll*** or ***proposal***.

![](apply_tags.png#width-80)

Look for the tag icon. When you start typing, existing tags will appear for you to add. Or if no tag with that word exists, you can create one.

![](category_tags.png#width-80)

# 2. Set up your personal profile

Your personal profile will help members of your group easily identify you, and have confidence that the messages they receive from you actually come from you.

* Click on the menu icon (☰) at top left to open the sidebar menu.
* Click on your name at the top of the sidebar to open the user menu.
* Select **Edit profile** option.

![](edit-profile.png#width-50)

## Upload a profile photo

Your initials will be the default image associated with your profile. To upload your profile photo:

* Click on **Change Picture** on the profile page
* Select **Upload new photo**

*Example:*

![](set-profile-photo1.png#width-80)

## Update your personal info

Check and update your profile on Loomio.

* **Name** - this name will appear next to all your comments
* **Email address** - your Loomio notifications will go to this address
* **Username** - can be used to **@mention** you in threads, so that you will be notified
* **Introduction** - a few lines to let others in your group know more about you, and that you are here to support their connected governance work
* **Location** - so people know where you (usually) are.

Note that your email address is not displayed to other users. Your email address can only be seen by administrators of your group in certain circumstances.

*Example:*

![](update-profile.png#width-80)

# 3. Manage group membership

Next, make sure all your directors have been invited to the group.

On your group home page, go to the **Members** tab.

There, you can see a list of all the members of the group.  You can also see when each member joined your group, and any invitations that have not yet been accepted.

If you have already invited people and they are yet to accept, you can use the 3 dot menu against their name to remind them — **Resend invitation**.

You can give anyone administrator level access with **Make admin** and if a person has a particular role within the group, you can give them a title such as ***chairperson*** with **Set title**.

![](members-tab.png#width-80)

## Adding and removing members

When your board membership changes, or when you want to involve an external person in your discussions temporarily, you can adjust your group’s membership.

To invite people to join the group you can either:
* **Invite** them from within Loomio by entering their email address and adding a message, or
* **Share** an invitation link via your email or other messaging service.

If you’re granting temporary membership, it’s a good idea to check [member permissions](##other-group-settings).

![](invite-people.png#width-80)

# 4. Start a thread

To help directors become familiar with using Loomio, try starting a new thread. It can introduce directors to the tools, and invite them to react with an emoji or comment. If every director responds, you’ll know they are all connected.

On your group home page, go to the **Threads** tab and use the button for **New Thread**.

![](new_thread.png#width-80)

**Thread**
When you start a new thread, you can choose where it will show up.
You can:
* post it to a **group**
* post it to a **subgroup**, or
* (for a private discussion with one or more people, or to draft a thread before posting it anywhere) create an **Invite-only thread
(no group)**.

**Title**
Give your thread a title; a few words that capture the purpose of the discussion. It’s worth considering how best to characterise this thread to distinguish it from any other. It could be a question, or it could refer to a place or date or event or document. The point is to convey the most information with the fewest characters, bearing in mind that over time you might have many other similar threads.

**Notify**
If you choose to notify people of the new thread, Loomio will send them an email about it. You can use the dropdown to select to notify members of the group or subgroup, or you can notify a **guest** by pasting their email address.

If you’re posting a series of new threads to a group, you might choose to notify no one. That way, the members will see it when they next come to Loomio, but they won’t receive an email about it.

**Tag**
Attach one or more tags to the thread to make it easy to find later. For this first one, perhaps a ‘how-to’ tag is appropriate?

**Context**
In the context, describe the purpose of the thread. You’ll see there are buttons for formatting the text, adding links and documents, but for your first thread, keep it simple.

**First thread suggestion**

![](Start_first_thread.png#width-80)

**Comment**
After you post the thread, you’ll see it’s possible to comment or to react with an emoji. Be sure to add a comment to demonstrate how to participate and explicitly ask people to respond.

# 5. Start a poll
Now, it’s time to familiarise directors with some of Loomio’s unique tools for discovering what the board as a whole thinks about something, and for moving from a discussion toward a decision.

The objective here is to get everyone to vote in a poll.

From within a thread, go to the tab marked **POLL**. You’ll see there are various options. The simplest one is **Check**. With this poll type, there are only two possible responses:
* a tick (✓) to say ‘yes’ or
* a cross (x) to say ‘no’ or ‘unsure’.

![](choose_poll.png#width-80)

Use a check poll to ask directors to confirm they are comfortable in Loomio. 

A day before the poll closes, Loomio will remind those who have not responded.

**Title**
Give your poll a short, relevant Title.

**Tags**
Attach any relevant Tags to help people find this poll later.

**Details**
In the Details field, explain what you are asking people to do.

**Options**
Each poll type provides different Options for responding. (In a check poll there are only 2.)

Consider the further options:

**Closing date and time**
Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.

**Reminder**
24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is **Undecided voters**.

**Who can vote?**
Invite everyone in the group or only the people.

By default, everyone in the group can see everyone's votes. But you can change that to make voting **anonymous** if you want to keep the individual votes secret. This is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.

**Check poll suggestion**

![](start_check.png#width-80)

**Voting**

Here is what people will see when responding to a poll request to vote:

![](check_vote.png#width-80)

# 6. Set up a subgroup?

Do you need a subgroup?  To determine whether your board needs one or more subgroups, see ["Setting up for success: What structure suits our board?"](https://help.loomio.org/en/oric/for-success.html#what-structure-suits-our-board).

To set up a subgroup, go to your group home page and toggle to the **Subgroups** tab. You’ll see a button there for **New Subgroup**.

Setting up a subgroup is similar to setting up a group. After you have created the group, check the settings as you did for the parent group.

To review group settings, see [Step 1](#1-adjust-group-settings-for-the-board) to set up your subgroup.

![](Subgroups.png#width-80)

**Permissions**

Do you want members of the parent group to be able to see subgroups even though they are not members of it? If so, on your subgroup home page, go to the settings cog and click **Edit group settings**.

Next, toggle to the **PERMISSIONS** tab. You’ll see a long list of options for who can do what. You can tick or untick as appropriate.
The very first one (if you are an admin for the group) is ‘Members of [your parent group] can see private threads’. If you tick that option, everyone will be able to see—but not participate in—threads and polls in the subgroup.

![](subgroup_settings.png#width-80)
