# For connectors

‘Connectors’ have special access and responsibilities in Loomio. Typically, a corporation’s connector is the person who provides administrative support to the board of directors.

Your connector’s primary objective is to **set up your Loomio group to work for your circumstances**. Your connector will also ***connect*** and exchange information—with:
* all the **directors** on their board—to ensure they can access and use the tools
* other corporations’ **connectors**—for comparing notes on using Loomio
* **Loomio**—for technical support
* **ORIC**—for any discussion of the ORIC–Loomio ‘Connected Governance’ project.

This part of the guide firstly invites you to assess how well-prepared your directors are for connected governance. Then it describes 6 concrete steps you can take to introduce your directors to your Loomio group and get them using it.

To galvanise you for the work, here’s a reminder of the benefits your corporation can reap when directors invest their time and energy in connected governance:

**Benefits of connected governance**

The board will own a secure, private space for its business and processes.
* Every director can see who said what, when.
* Every director can contribute in their own time.
* The board can do routine tasks online to free up time in meetings for discussions that matter.
* Polls offer directors a powerful way to gain a wholeboard perspective.
* When directors disagree, they can see where and why, and work to build consensus.

**Purpose: To set up Loomio effectively for your board.**

Our aim is to encourage directors to join and participate in your Loomio group. They should be easily able to:
* Sign in to Loomio ( decisions.oric.gov.au )
* Read and comment on threads
* Vote in polls and proposals
* See how your governance practices work in Loomio

**Using this Guide**

There are a series of steps to the guide. Work through these or navigate to a section using the table of contents.  Reach out to [Loomio support](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact) for further help if needed.

# Are your directors ready for connected governance?

**Technology & digital literacy**

Connected governance requires directors to use a computer or smartphone connected to the internet. They must be capable of sending and receiving email, browsing the web, reading digital documents and viewing and hearing videos.

Check that each director has all of the following:

* an **up-to-date device**—a computer, tablet or smart phone with email and a modern internet browser
* **internet service** via WIFI, ethernet cable or mobile data plan (3G or above)
* **capability** to send and receive email, browse the internet, download documents and play videos.

If a director lacks capability in some areas, is there a person in the corporation—or a friend or family member—who can support them?

Loomio works with all standard internet browsers such as Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, Firefox and Apple Safari. Old out-of-date browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explorer may not work.

If you have a problem using Loomio on your device, [Contact Loomio support](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact).

# 1. Adjust group settings for the board

## Group settings

Your Loomio group comes pre-configured to help you get started. As a connector you have administrative rights for the group.  This means you can edit group settings.

Please review each of the following settings and make whatever changes will best suit your corporation.

*On your group home page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit group settings**.*

You will land in the settings for your group’s Profile, where you can adjust the following:

**Group name**: The name of your corporation is the default. Make it your own.

**Handle**: A simplified label for your group that becomes part of the web address for it. Tip short is good!

**Cover image**: Upload an image that represents your corporation. *(Replace the stock image.)*

**Logo**: Upload your logo to appear alongside your group name when people visit your group.

![](https://i.imgur.com/lMpyr2K.png#border-none)

**Group Description**: The group description is the first place people see when they arrive into your Loomio group. Write it to help new directors to understand the purpose of the group and the work you will do together. Provide any other information that orients people and encourages them to participate.

A template description for your group is provided. You can edit or replace with your own text, upload or link to any relevant documents. A wide range of formatting tools are available to help you, including:

* **Attach files**: Use the paper clip icon to attach files from your computer. *(Find this just below the group description box.)*
* **Insert link**: Go to the internet page you want to link to, copy the link to your clipboard. Highlight the text that you want to link. Click Insert link and paste the link and click ***Apply***.

**An example of a group description**

![](group-description-template-1.png#width-90)

Once you’re happy with the group profile, check the other tabs for PRIVACY, PERMISSIONS and THREADS. You are free to make any changes you wish but the following suggestions may help.

## Other Group settings

**Privacy** 

Check your group privacy is set to **Secret**. That means people will only know the group exists if they have been invited to it.

![](https://i.imgur.com/EXGZqWY.png#border-none)

**Permissions**

As group administrator you can modify what members of your group are allowed to do.  Permissions are initially set to balance safety and freedom to use the main features of Loomio.

![](https://i.imgur.com/fHiM0NC.png#border-none)

## Tags

Use tags to make it easy to find threads of a particular type or on a particular topic.

Your Loomio group is pre-configured with the following tags.

*Admin, AGM, Board meeting, Report, Finance, Legal, Members, Minutes, Planning, Policy, Resolution, Rule book, General meeting, Strategy, Template.*

On the ***Threads*** page there is a dropdown arrow to see your tags.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Lwz23oc.png#border-none)

You can create and apply tags when you start or edit a ***thread***, ***poll*** or ***proposal***.

![](https://i.imgur.com/1tGXeFO.png#border-none)

Look for the tag icon. When you start typing, existing tags will appear for you to add. Or if no tag with that word exists, you can create one.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ydlPlCm.png#border-none)

# 2. Set up your personal profile

Your personal profile will help members of your group easily identify you, and have confidence that the messages they receive from you actually come from you.

* Click on the menu icon (☰) at top left to open the sidebar menu.
* Click on your name at the top of the sidebar to open the user menu.
* Select **Edit profile** option.

![](set-profile-photo1.png#width-80)

## Update your personal info

Check and update your profile on Loomio.

* **Name** - this name will appear next to all your comments
* **Email address** - your Loomio notifications will go to this address
* **Username** - can be used to **@mention** you in threads, so that you will be notified
* **Introduction** - a few lines to let others in your group know more about you, and that you are here to support their connected governance work
* **Location** - so people know where you (usually) are.

Note that your email address is not displayed to other users. Your email address can only be seen by administrators of your group in certain circumstances.

*Example:*

![](update-profile.png#width-80)

# 3. Invite board members

Now we have prepared our Loomio group, let’s invite directors.

On your group home page, go to the **Members** tab.

On the Members page you can see who are the members of your Loomio group.  You can also easily see when a member joined your group, and any invitations that have not yet been accepted.

You can remind people you have invited with **Resend invitation**, give anyone administrator level access with **Make admin** and add a person’s title with **Set title** such as Chairperson.

*Example:*

![](members-tab.png#width-80)

## Invite people

You can invite people to join the Loomio group either by sending a message to their email address via Loomio, or **Share** an invitation link via your email service or in a newsletter.

* Click **Invite**
* Type or copy/paste the email addresses of the directors you want to invite

You can add an optional message to encourage people to click the invitation button:

*Example:*

*Hi, please join our private Loomio group. We use this space to notify directors of meetings, prepare and vote on resolutions, discuss topics between meetings, and to record decisions in a searchable archive.*


- ***Tip**: If you have a lot of people to invite, you can copy up to 100 email addresses at a time from a list, such as from a spreadsheet column.*

*Example:*

![](invite-people.png#width-80)

# 4. Start a first thread

Start a thread to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We can use this thread to introduce Loomio to directors, and invite them to post a comment.

**Objective: Let’s get each director to post a comment so we know that directors are connected.**

* On your group home page, go to the **Threads** tab.
* Click **New Thread**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/ednBbOD.png#border-none)

**Thread**

Threads are where your group can discuss a topic, exchange information and make decisions together. Threads keep everything about a topic in the same place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your group’s discussions and decisions.

- ***Tip**: Use a Loomio thread instead of writing an email.*

- *All the information, discussion and replies are in one place, where you can see who has read the thread, and nudge people if needed; avoiding email chain confusion.*

**Group** - Select the group or subgroup you want to post the thread in. When started, your thread will be visible to the members of your group or subgroup.

You can also select **Invite-only thread (no group)** if you want to have a private discussion with one or more people, or if you want to draft a thread before posting in your group.

**Title** - Give your thread a title; this is usually announcing a topic or asking a question. Keep it short and to the point.  A thread title is like the subject line in an email.

**Notify** - You can choose to notify people by sending them an email of the thread via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.

* Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.  
* Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.

**Tag** - Choose a tag for your thread to make it easy to find threads of a certain type or topic, or create a new tag.

**First thread suggestion**

![](Start_first_thread.png#width-80)


# 5. Start a first Poll
Let’s start a poll to help directors become familiar with using Loomio.
We use Polls and Proposal to make decisions and request a response.

**Objective: Let's get everyone to vote in a poll, so they're ready when we get to work.**

You start a **Poll** or **Proposal** from within a Thread.

* Go to the thread that you wish to start your poll and click on the **Poll** tab.
* Select the type of poll you want to use. Let’s start with **Check**.

![](https://i.imgur.com/Vq5DB6A.png#border-none)

**Start Check**

A check is a tool with many possible uses but only 2 responses: a tick (✔) or an x mark (✘). Participants will use the tick (✔) to say yes and the x mark (✘) to say no or unsure.

Use it to engage people with an offer, like an RSVP: *"I'm coming to the event"*, *"I'll join the subcommittee"* or *"I have completed my actions"*.

A day before the check closes, Loomio will remind people who have not participated.

**Title** - Give your poll a title. Keep it short and to the point.  

**Tags** - Select a tag that will help people easily find this poll when searching.

**Details** - Explain what you are asking people to do and how to participate.

**Options** - Select the poll voting options.  Each poll type provides different options.

**Closing date and time** - Select the closing date and time for your poll. Give sufficient time for people to vote.  If necessary, you can close the poll early or extend the closing time.

**Reminder** - 24 hours before the poll closes Loomio can send an automatic reminder. Choose if you want to enable this and who to send to.  The default option is **Undecided voters**.

**Who can vote?** - You can decide who is voting; anyone in your group or only the people you specifically invite.

The default settings is everyone in the group can see who has voted. However you can select anonymous voting if you want to keep the identity of voters secret. 

***Tip**: Anonymous voting is useful for elections or if you think voters might be influenced by how others vote.

**Check poll suggestion**

![](https://i.imgur.com/SpLVTMc.png#border-none)

**Invite to vote** - You can choose to invite people by sending them an email of the poll via Loomio. You can select any group or subgroup of people.

* Click on the group name to see individual people to notify.
* Click the X beside a person’s name to remove a person from the notification list.

**Voting**

Here is what people will see when responding to a Poll request to vote:

# 6. Subgroups

Do you need a subgroup? Subgroups help you organize the work of particular groups of people; for example a subcommittee, working group or project team. You may also set up a subgroup for communicating with membership.

Subgroups work just like groups and are located within your "parent" group or organization.

Most of the features and settings are the same as in your parent group, and include the ability to allow members of the parent group to see, but not participate in, threads and polls in the subgroup. This is helpful if you want to offer transparency of discussions and decisions to members of the parent group.

A person can be a member of your subgroup and not of your parent group.

Typical subgroups for Indigenous Corporations include:
* Financial subcommittee
* Health & Safety
* Risks & Audits
* Industry-specific subgroup such as Property

![](board-subgroups.png#border-none)

## Set up a subgroup

On your group home page, go to the **Subgroups** tab and click **New Subgroup**.

Follow a similar process as in [Step 1](#1-set-up-your-board-on-loomio) to set up your subgroup.

![](https://i.imgur.com/loeydDj.png#border-none)

**Permissions**

To allow members of your parent group see threads in the subgroup:

On your subgroup home page, go to the **Settings** tab and click **Edit group settings**.

Change permissions by ticking or un-ticking the check box.

# Why Loomio?

Loomio is an online place for the board to have discussions and make decisions together:

* Accessible, transparent and inclusive; stay connected wherever you have internet access
* Build consensus
