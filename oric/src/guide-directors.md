# Guide for directors using Loomio

Loomio is a private and secure service for your board to **talk about matters, make decisions and keep track** of everything. Using Loomio between meetings means that when you do meet in person, you can focus on what matters most.

This Loomio service is provided by the Office of Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC), to strengthen governance in Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations. Your group will be in the following ORIC domain: **[decisions.oric.gov.au](https://decisions.oric.gov.au)** << *(bookmark that address in your browser)*

Know that **no one from ORIC has access** to your group. It's private for your board members and whoever else you invite.

## Minimum requirements

Loomio works on standard hardware and software. There is no need to download any software or app but you do need:

* a computer, tablet or smartphone with a **current browser** (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari),
* an **email** application (such as Outlook, Gmail, Protonmail)
* **internet service** via wifi (wireless network), ethernet (cable) or mobile data plan (3G or above)

Old browsers such as Internet Explorer might not work.

If you have problems seeing Loomio on your device, please contact [Loomio Support](https://www.loomio.org/contact) or email [contact@loomio.org](mailto:contact@loomio.org).

## Create your path into Loomio

You will receive an **email invitation** to join your board's Loomio group. You don’t need a password, and your computer will remember you (if you let it).

In the middle of the email is a button to **accept invitation**. Use it! It will open a webpage where you can create an account on the service at decisions.oric.gov.au.

On that webpage you will see a button to **CONTINUE WITH EMAIL**. Use that button and you will land at a page to create your Loomio user account:

![](create-account.png)

Type in your name, so people in your group will recognise you.

Use the **CREATE ACCOUNT** button, bottom-right. You will then have an account on [decisions.oric.gov.au](https://decisions.oric.gov.au). << Bookmark that page in your browser, and/or create a shortcut on your phone. That way, next time you want to enter the Loomio group space, it's just a tap away.

## Set how you present yourself

You can add **a picture of yourself**, to display next to all the comments you make. That makes it easy for other directors to see who said what. 

When you first join Loomio, it invites you to add a picture—or to instead use your initials (the first letters of your first and last names).

To add a photo to your profile, tap to **upload new photo**. Browse to a suitable photo file from your computer. (It will show up small, so a photo of your face is best.)

![](upload-photo.png#width-40)

Once you select the photo you want, use the button marked **open** to upload it. You can always change it later.

You might want to add more detail to your profile, especially if you don't know your other board members very well. At the top left of your screen you'll see your photo or initials. Tap there, and select **edit profile**. 

Here, you can **introduce yourself**, your expertise, interests, affiliations. You can also add your **location**. There's a field to set your language, but sadly, Loomio is not yet translated into any Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander languages :(

## Threads, comments and other responses
A **thread** is where your board will discuss corporation concerns and make governance decisions. Your group page will list each thread, like this:

![](thread-list-a.png#width-40)

Scroll down the thread to read other people's comments. You'll reach a place where you can write your own.

Make sure that the **comment** tab is highlighted and write in the space alongside your profile image. There are buttons below that space to add documents, images, links—and to format your words (make a heading, bold or italic, list items, and so on).

When you are ready, use the button to **POST COMMENT**.

![](comment.png#width-40)

If you see something you want to change, you can **edit** your comment. To do that, tap the small pencil icon at the bottom-right of a comment.

## Voting in a poll
Polls help groups to make decisions. Your board will probably use polls to:
- approve minutes
- pass resolutions and 
- find times to meet.

When someone adds a poll, it appears in the mini-navigation in the right-hand sidebar of the thread.

Here is an example of a poll:

**To vote**

Tap on the icon that best matches your response. You can also leave a reason or comment about why you chose that option.

Then **SUBMIT VOTE**

## Frequently asked questions from people new to Loomio

**Q. Who sent the invitation or notification email?**

A. The email was sent by someone you know, likely the chair of your board, or CEO or administrator of your corporation.

**Q. Is it safe?**  

A. Yes, you have been invited to a private online space set up specifically for your board.  

**Q. How can I know it is safe?**

A. Here are some checks you can do:
- Do you recognise the name of the person who has invited you?
- Do you recognise the name of your corporation?
- Were you expecting an invitation?

If your answers are all yes, it is most likely a valid message.

**Q. Do I have to sign in every time I use Loomio?**

A. If this is your computer, it should 'remember' you and keep you signed in to Loomio. However, you will need to sign in again if you reset your computer or use Loomio on a different computer or phone.

**Q. Do I need a password?**

A. No, you don’t need a password, but you can use one if you prefer. If you have trouble receiving email, it's a good idea to set up a password to access your Loomio group.

## Troubleshooting

**Problem: I can’t receive email**

Solution: Your Loomio user account is linked to your preferred email address.  If you cannot access your email, you will need to sign into Loomio with a password.

If you need a password set up to access Loomio, contact [Loomio support](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/contact).

**Problem: I need my invitation to Loomio sent as a text message to my phone**

Solution: Contact Loomio support so we can generate an SMS text for you. It will look something like:

> *Hi, this is Michael from Loomio. Use the link below to reach your board's page on Loomio. Follow the instructions to set up your user account and tap ‘Sign in via email’. Any problems, just reply to this text. Thanks!*
> 
> *[decisions.oric.gov.au](https://decisions.oric.gov.au)*
