# A guide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations using Loomio for good decision-making and accountability

*This guide was made for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations in the ORIC–Loomio ‘connected governance’ program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking to use Loomio for good governance.*

Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's **context** and set up a system and processes to serve its **purpose** and meet their **obligations** under the law.

*“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”* That's a [description of good governance](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf) from the United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific.

Open communication is at its heart.

You can use Loomio to strengthen governance: **collaborate** beyond board meetings, **include everyone** in open, honest and respectful discussion, and **document everything** as you go. Then when directors do come together at the same time, they can ratify all the key decisions.

Loomio—and this guide to using it—will help your board to **communicate well**, **make good decisions** and **be accountable**.

## Within this guide
This guide includes the following sections:
- [Loomio key concepts](key-concepts-oric.md)
- [Guide for directors using Loomio](guide-directors.md)
- [Guide for connectors managing Loomio for their corporation](guide-connectors.md)
- [Setting up for success](for-success.md)

There are also some practical resources, as below.

## Sandpit
If you want to try out a Loomio group—start a thread, comment, create a proposal or poll—with no impact on your real Loomio group, you can [create a temporary demo group](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try). Think of it as a sandpit. Feel free to play around, respond to a thread or a poll, or create your own. Please don't worry about making a mess: your whole group will disappear after 24 hours.

## Templates
When you create a demonstration group (as above, in the 'sandpit') you'll see examples of threads you might create in your real group for the board of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. 

Loomio is also building a new feature that will support you in common tasks like preparing for a board meeting. When that feature goes live, you won't have to create a new thread from scratch. You'll be able to create a thread from a template.
