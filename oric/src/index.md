# A guide for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations using Loomio for good decision-making and accountability

*This guide was made for Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations in the ORIC–Loomio ‘connected governance’ program, but it may be of interest to anyone seeking to use Loomio for good governance.*

## Background & introduction

Good governance happens when directors understand their corporation's **context** and set up a system and processes to serve its **purpose** and meet their **obligations** under the law.

> *“It is participatory, consensus-oriented, accountable, transparent, responsive, effective and efficient, equitable and inclusive and follows the rule of law.”* 
> [United Nations Economic and Social Commission for Asia and the Pacific](https://www.unescap.org/sites/default/d8files/knowledge-products/good-governance.pdf).

**Open communication** is at its heart.

### Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC)

Office of the Registrar of Indigenous Corporations (ORIC) knows that boards of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations face various challenges. The following are just some examples.
- Directors live in different places—and they’re busy people—so it’s difficult to arrange to meet regularly in person.
- Some corporations deal with a high volume of transactional business (such as approvals for land use and financial transactions).
- Corporations’ governance frameworks and practices may still be forming.
- In many remote locations around Australia, internet service is poor.
- Some directors are unfamiliar with online technology, and/or have low literacy.
- The legacy of historical dispossession, separation and loss means that some corporations struggle with long-standing internal conflicts.

It is ORIC’s role to support corporations to govern in accordance with:
- the CATSI Act
- your rule book and
- your cultural obligations.
With all those challenges in mind, we looked around for a tool and service that goes farthest to meet the complex needs of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations—and we found Loomio.

### Loomio

Loomio is a New Zealand-based cooperative. It offers a collaborative online working space for groups to make decisions.

Loomio offers a chance to strengthen governance by enabling your board to:
- extend collaboration beyond board meetings
- include everyone in open, honest and respectful discussion
- document everything as it happens.

We want to set you up for success, not only in using the tools, but to govern well and achieve the objectives of your corporation. We hope that Loomio—and this guide to using it—will help your board to:
- communicate well
- make good decisions and
- be accountable.

## Within this guide
This guide includes the following sections:
- [Loomio key concepts](key-concepts-oric.md)
- [Guide for directors using Loomio](guide-directors.md)
- [Guide for connectors managing Loomio for their corporation](guide-connectors.md)
- [Setting up for success](for-success.md)

There are also some practical resources, as below.

## Sandpit
If you want to try out a Loomio group—start a thread, comment, create a proposal or poll—with no impact on your real Loomio group, you can [create a temporary demo group](https://decisions.oric.gov.au/try). Think of it as a sandpit. Feel free to play around, respond to a thread or a poll, or create your own. Please don't worry about making a mess: your whole group will disappear after 24 hours.

## Templates
When you create a demonstration group (as above, in the 'sandpit') you'll see examples of threads you might create in your real group for the board of an Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporation. 

Loomio is also building a new feature that will support you in common tasks like preparing for a board meeting. When that feature goes live, you won't have to create a new thread from scratch. You'll be able to create a thread from a template.
