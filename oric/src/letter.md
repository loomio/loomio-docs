# Invitation letter to ORIC Corporations

**To: Leaders and directors of Aboriginal and Torre Strait Islander Corporations**

You are invited to join the ORIC Loomio Pilot programme.

## Background
Boards are experiencing many challenges to effectively govern their Corporation, such as: 
* Getting directors together in-person for meetings
* Unfamiliarity with the use of online tools
* Located remotely where there is poor internet connectivity
* Unsure of governance practices, or they are still forming
* Differing levels of engagement and understanding in the board
* Trying to tackle a high volume of work in time constrained environment 
* Increasing regulatory reporting pressures and member/stakeholder

We would like to help you develop good governance using digital communication tools and have initiated a Pilot programme.

## Loomio ORIC Pilot
Loomio is an online tool for discussion and decision-making that can help you strengthen governance.

We have set up a special service on Loomio, along with training and support, at no cost to qualifying organisations during the Pilot.

We expect the project to run for approximately 12 months, until the end of April 2022.

We have great hopes for the project. We anticipate that using Loomio will:
* save you time—as a channel for the administrative business of directors’ meetings (eg sharing and approving the minutes)
* improve corporation decision-making—as a tool designed to facilitate discussion and decision-making
* increase transparency and accountability to members—as a conduit for key questions and decisions to members

## Want to learn more?
We run regular online webinar sessions for your Chairperson and/or Chief Executive to learn more about how Loomio can help governance for your Corporation.

**RSVP by registering your interest with Catherine Styles at ORIC.**

Select and book your preferred webinar session:
- TBA

The session is 1 hour duration, via Zoom video call at the following times:
* 9am AWST
* 10.30am ACST
* 11am AEST
* 1pm New Zealand

## Getting started with Loomio
When you are ready to get started; please identify a person familiar with the IT and technology of your organisation, and the person who takes care of board administration. Send us their name and email addresses (it's ok if they are the same person). 

We will then set up a Loomio group for your Corporation and get in touch to arrange training and onboarding, and book a timeslot in your next board meeting to introduce Loomio to directors. 

We ask you to spend 10 minutes responding to a baseline survey about your corporation’s current governance.

And we expect you to actively use Loomio tools for your board decision-making. 

If you have a question or concern, contact either your trained administrator or Loomio for support.

## Data sovereignty
Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander corporations participating in this programme will have sovereignty over their data. ORIC will have access to metrics about their use of Loomio, and any quantitative and qualitative data that directors provide as part of evaluating their own governance and the Loomio service. ORIC will have no access to any substantive data about corporations’ deliberations or decisions.

Loomio takes good care in relation to your [privacy](https://help.loomio.com/en/legal/privacy/), and has set up a private service for this pilot on the Amazon Web Services (AWS) data centre in Sydney, Australia.

## Questions?
Please ask :-)

Warm regards, 
Cath, Michael, Lisa and Rahul
