# Subscription pricing
_How we price Loomio to make it available to everyone._

# Overview
Loomio exists to make it easy for anyone, anywhere, to participate in decisions that affect their lives.

As a social enterprise and worker cooperative, our values are reflected in both the design of the software and how we operate as a business.

We do not monetize your data or attention. We will never sell your data or use it for advertising purposes. You own your own content and you are free to export your data at any time.

## Inclusive pricing model
Our goal is to provide Loomio to as many people as possible, while also developing the Loomio platform so it can better serve you.

To sustainably work towards our vision, we have structured our pricing based on the type of organization we serve.

We aim to offer a competitive price for enterprise organizations, an affordable price for businesses, nonprofit organizations, and special rates for community groups.

Loomio is open source software, and you are free to set up your own instance of Loomio for internal use in your organization.  

We offer services to help you set up and operate Loomio on a private server.

# Loomio Cloud subscription plans

A Loomio subscription is one price per group - a subscription plan for your organization. People you invite into your Loomio group are not charged.

Loomio subscriptions are on a pre-pay basis and cover the use of the service for the selected subscription period.

All plans come with:

## Free trial
All new Loomio Cloud groups start on a free trial, so you can evaluate Loomio for your organization.

Free trials are for 7 days, limited to 10 people and 10 threads.

At the end of the trial period you will be asked to upgrade to a paid subscription plan.

## Community plan
We encourage community and volunteer groups with a special price.

The Community plan is available for community groups and organizations run by volunteers who have **no full-time paid staff**.

Price: $US 10.00 per month or $US 199.00 one-time payment.

Community plan includes:
- Single Loomio group of up to 100 users
- Unlimited subgroups
- All discussion, decision and facilitation features
- Self-service set up with Loomio’s online guides

The Community Lifetime option:
- Single payment for the life of your group

To access these special rates, just select the Community plan when you upgrade your group.

If you are in doubt whether the Community plan applies to your group, you may ask *“am I being paid by my organization to do this work?”* If yes, it’s likely a Loomio Starter or Pro plan is more appropriate for your organization. We trust you to make the right decision.  

We will check in with you once a year, near the annual renewal date of your plan, to see if you are still actively using Loomio and if your group still meets the criteria for the Community plan. If your group has acquired funding and at least one full-time staff member, we will invite you to upgrade to the Loomio Starter or Loomio Pro plan.

This plan is “self-service” with limited support. However you can learn all you need to use Loomio effectively with [Loomio Help](https://help.loomio.com) which includes the user manual and guides.
