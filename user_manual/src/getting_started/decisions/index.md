# Making Collaborative Decisions

Decisions are where you can progress a discussion to an outcome.

- Involve the right people to make better decisions 
- Apply the decision making process that works for your group - seek advice or consent, or reach a consensus
- Get engagement, test ideas, and clarify an issue, even if the solution might not yet be apparent 
- Set a deadline, prompt people who haven’t participated, and state an outcome

There are many types of decision tools in Loomio and many ways to use them.   

This doesn’t mean that everyone must agree all of the time, and there are many ways to reach a collective decision.

## Proposal

At the heart of Loomio is the proposal.  

A proposal helps convert a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. For example someone suggests a course of action and invites people to respond by voting agree, abstain or disagree. Other proposal options are available to suit common decision-making processes.

As people vote, they can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if the proposal is still open, you can change your response.

In this way you can use proposals to prompt people for a response, uncover new information, and build shared understanding - to help your group make a better, more informed decision.

A proposal and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.
