# What is Loomio and how can it help your organization?

Loomio is a decision making tool for collaborative organizations.

It enables you to bring people together, have discussions, make proposals and achieve clear outcomes.

It's a discussion forum with a set of tools to allow you to facilitate a discussion towards an outcome, for example proposal and polls.

Loomio is often used for:

**Boards and Governance** to prepare for meetings, build and agree agenda, post board papers, vote on resolutions, approve minutes and make decisions between meetings.

**Member organizations** to share information and raise topics, seek input and advice,  enable members to participate in important decisions, and include more members in a General Assembly.

**Self-organizing teams** to work together in structured decision making processes, share info and ideas, progress discussions, make proposals and achieve better outcomes.

Loomio builds a living record of your organization; the decisions made, who was involved and the discussion they had together leading to the decision. 

## How Loomio works

Loomio is a simple structure of three main elements; Group, Thread and Decisions. 

### Group

A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, discuss and make decisions about work.

**Group home**

Your group home page is the first place you see when you arrive. It contains a title, an image to represent the group, and some text to introduce the group: its purpose, the work you will do, and any other information to help group members participate.

### Thread

Threads are where you share information, discuss, and make decisions.

Threads are used for many purposes; to prepare for a meeting, discuss matters, share reports, ask questions, vote on proposals, approve actions, and so on. It's also where your group can develop a shared understanding of important issues.

Threads keep everything about a topic in one place. Over time you’ll create a useful archive of your organization’s discussions and decisions.

### Decisions

One of the best things about Loomio is its range of tools to progress a discussion to an outcome. Each tool has a slightly different purpose. The most common one is a proposal. 

![](Proposals.png#width-50)

A **proposal** is for converting a discussion into a clear, practical outcome. Someone suggests a course of action and invites everyone to respond. For example, you might ask group members to either:
- agree
- abstain or 
- disagree. 

Importantly, as well as selecting a response, everyone can give a reason why they have voted this way. You can all see where everyone else stands on the matter, and why. And then, if you want, you can change your response. 

A proposal, and associated discussion, creates its own record of how the decision came about.

### Other voting tools

A proposal is good for suggesting a particular path and gauging who wants to take it. But sometimes you might want group members to make a different kind of choice. 

Loomio offers a range of other poll tools:

- **Poll**: to ask people which option/s they approve
- **Check**: think of it as asking everyone to (please) 'raise your hand if you…'
- **Time poll**: to find the best time for the group to do something
- **Score poll**: to ask people to express the strength of their preference for each option, on a numerical scale
- **Dot vote**: to ask people to express the strength of their preferences, with a constraint—a fixed number of ‘dots’ to allocate–you can put all your dots in one place or spread them out
- **Ranked choice**: to rank a subset of options—useful for elections when there are many candidates and few seats

## Putting it all together

The best way to learn what to use when is to have a go. Use your own group or [start a demo group](https://loomio.org/try).
