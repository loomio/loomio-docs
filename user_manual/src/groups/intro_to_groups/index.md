# Intro to Groups

A Loomio group is a safe place for your organization to meet, have discussions and make decisions about work.

## Group home page

Your group home page is the first place people will see when they arrive to your group - make them welcome, and make it their home!

Design your Loomio group experience by adding a cover image and logo to help people feel at home.  

Write a group description that clearly states *why* the group exists, *what kind of work* you are going to do, *who the members* of the group are, and *how they can participate*.
 
### Your group home page is also a resource hub

Your Loomio group page is a place to store all of the information, links and files, that everyone in your group needs.
