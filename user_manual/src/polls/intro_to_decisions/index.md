# Intro to decisions

Decisions are where you can progress a discussion to an outcome.

- Involve the right people to make better decisions 
- Apply the decision making process that works for your group - seek advice or consent, or reach a consensus
- Get engagement, test ideas, and clarify an issue, even if the solution might not yet be apparent 
- Set a deadline, prompt people who haven’t participated, and state an outcome

There are many types of decision tools in Loomio and many ways to use them.   

This doesn’t mean that everyone must agree all of the time, and there are many ways to reach a collective decision.
