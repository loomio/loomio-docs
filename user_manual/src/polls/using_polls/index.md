Introducing templates


# [Introducing Poll and Thread templates - first pass](https://app.tango.us/app/workflow/a474cec4-351a-44c0-b33d-e67bfb09b67b?utm_source=markdown&utm_medium=markdown&utm_campaign=workflow%20export%20links)

__Description:__ 
Hi, I'm delighted to tell you about a big update that both simplifies how you use Loomio day to day, and provides much more flexibility to create your own templates and decision-making processes.

In this video we are going to

*   introduce two new poll types - 'Sense check' and 'Opt-in'
    
*   show how you can configure polls to suit a particular decision process or voting method
    
*   outline how you can build decision making processes and save these as templates
    

**Configurable Proposals**
--------------------------

We have learnt a lot over the last 3 or 4 years about how people use proposals and how they apply decision making processes in Loomio.  

  
The most popular feature request is for proposals to be more configurable - so you can change voting options to suit the way you want to work.

When you next start or open a Loomio thread, you’ll notice there are now just 2 tabs in the thread. We have combined proposal within the Polls tab - after all Proposal is a type of poll.
