# Engaging with threads
_Comments and tools such as thread translation and thread emails._

## Thread context

The thread **context** has special status within a thread. It's always at the top, and it's always visible on the page.

![](context_panel.png)

Like a comment, you can format your text and attach files or images. Unlike a comment, anyone in the group can update the context (and the title of the thread) by default. This means you can enable anyone to pitch in and help keep things easy to understand and easy to find.

> **Tip:** As the thread grows, update the context with key understandings and information so new people can catch up and participate easily.

The context is like the whiteboard in your meeting room, where you can write the agenda, the hopeful outcomes and how you aim to get there, and take group notes. *Learn more about preparing threads and groups for success [in our Facilitator's Guide](/en/facilitators_guide).*

### Add attachments

Use the paper clip icon, just below the text form, to add attachments from your computer.

### Remove attachments

While editing the context, click the **X** to the right of the attachment's name.

## Formatting

Use the formatting tools underneath the space in which you write (any form). Hover the mouse/cursor over each item to know what it is. There's a number of format options listed below, and a few are explained in more detail further down.

- stylize (bold, italics, code block…)
- create lists (eg, checklists)
- turn text into hyperlinks - _links icon_
- add attachments (from your device) - _paper clip icon_
- embed video - _play button icon_
- create and modify tables - _icon with four squares_.

### Link to a Google doc

You can add a link to a Google doc in Loomio anywhere there is a text space; when starting a thread or poll, writing a comment, or updating your group description. The link icon is one of the formatting tools under the space you can write text in Loomio.

To use the link icon, 
1. Select the text you want to link to - say the name of a document
2. Click the link icon
3. Find the document link - go to your Google drive and ‘Get link’, or go to the Google doc and ‘Share link’.  Check the link permissions so members can open the link - usually ‘Anyone with the link’. Copy the link to your clipboard.
4. Now, go back to Loomio and paste the link.

A preview of the doc will appear under the text space. You can remove this if you want.

Now, anyone with access to your Loomio thread and permission to view the doc can open and read it.

### Embed videos

Click the video icon from the formatting tools listed underneath any form (comment, thread…) and paste the link of most modern video hosting websites (ie, Youtube, Vimeo…).

### Markdown

To revert to markdown editing, click **M↓**. _If you click this while there is text in the form, some formatting may be lost upon conversion._

#### WYSIWYG

Click **WYSIWYG** to return to the formatting tools. This will convert any text and markdown formatting to display how it will appear when posted. ***PREVIEW*** _also shows you how your text will appear, but without converting._

### Checklist

From the lists dropdown, choose **Checklist**.

![](task_list_bar.png)

Click on the checklist/ tick boxes in order to cross out that to-do from the edit form of any context or thread you have permission to edit. _I.e., you cannot tick boxes in someone elses comment._

## Comments and replies
The most common activity in a thread is commenting. Comments are shared with everyone in the thread – usually this is just the members of your group. First look for **Comment** and your user photo (or initials).

![](comments_and_facilitation_box.png)
_Make sure that Comment is highlighted, not Proposal or Poll._

Write your comment and press **Post** to have your say.

Replies are like comments except in that the author of the original comment will be notified of your reply. Click **reply** on the comment you would like to associate your comment with, as it will be nested underneath theirs – by default – in the thread in which you replied.

You can reply to your _own_ comment in order to nest your reply underneath the comment. Click the three horizontal dots (**⋯**) to find **reply** in this case.

If Loomio has emailed you a comment and says you can reply to the email, you can reply directly from your email and your message will appear in the thread.

## Editing comments
If you've made a typo, or want to add a bit more information to your comment shortly after you've posted it, click **edit** on your comment. Editing does not take anyone else's attention with notifications nor unread signals.

![](edit_comment.png)

Changes you've made will be visible _to others_ via the **edited** button, so you can see what people have changed in their comment.

![](comment_history_button.png)

![](comment_history_modal.png)

If you have new information or are coming back after an extended period of time, just make a new comment, then people who have already read your comment will see that there is new information.


## Reactions
![](reactions.png)
Click **react** on any thread context or comment to share how a comment made you feel, or acknowledge something someone has said, without writing a comment. They're a light-weight way to participate without interrupting the conversation, and they only send a notification within the app (not by email).

## Automatic translation
<iframe width="100%" height="380px" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ZI_ZxJKoiy0?rel=0" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Loomio can translate user content (eg, votes, comments…) from one language into another automatically (with the help of Google Translate). If the author of a comment uses a language other than yours, **Translate comment** will be available in the drop-down options of the comment in question, from the three horizontal dots (**⋯**).

## Facilitation and Decision tools
![](facilitation_tools_tabs.png)
There are a selection of **facilitation tools** and **decision tools** available to you from within the thread.

- Proposals are there to help you see if there is agreement about a statement or course of action, and surface the disagreement if that's what needs to happen. Often, you can use proposals to bring the discussion to conclusion.
- Polls are useful to understand preferences of the group.
- Use a time poll if you need to get everyone together, and want to find the best time for that meeting to happen.

Find out more about [decision tools](en/guides/getting_started/decision_tools).

## Email notifications
By default

- you will receive an email with everything you missed the day before as a daily digest
- you will receive immediately emails for all activity in threads in which you have participated

To change these defaults and more… [→ Notifications](/en/user_manual/users/email_settings)

### Setting email notifications for individual threads
You can adjust your email settings per thread, so that you can mute conversations that will never matter to you and get all activity immediately for those critical to you (and everything in between).

To do this, use the **subscribe** button at the bottom of the thread's context. If you want to see this or learn more about email settings… [→ Thread email settings & Subscribe](/en/user_manual/users/email_settings/#thread-email-settings-subscribe)
