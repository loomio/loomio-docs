# Intro to Threads

Loomio threads are where you can share information, discuss topics, and make decisions with your group.  People participate by posting comments and replies.

- All info about a topic is in one easily accessible place.
- People can reply via email and their comments appear in the thread.
- You can see who has read the thread and who needs a nudge.
- You can progress actual work to an outcome.

Threads have a wide range of uses; from a general discussion forum to running specific work-flow and decision-making processes.

For example, you may facilitate an open discussion on a topic, inviting people to contribute their thoughts and opinions, and progress the discussion towards an agreed outcome.

Or you may invite people to participate in a particular decision, using a consent or advice decision-making process.

Threads can also contain polls and proposals to help progress a discussion to an outcome. As people comment in the thread and vote in polls, a thread timeline builds so you can easily find key milestones.

### Using threads

Here are some common uses of threads:

## Boards and Governance

**Prepare for a meeting** - Build an agenda, post board papers and organize administrative matters so everyone is up to date, in context and prepared. 

**Pass a resolution** - Post context and background information, respond to questions and raise a proposal to pass a resolution. 

**Discuss an agenda item on Loomio** - Start discussion about an agenda item prior to your meeting. Or, if you run out of time in the meeting, move the discussion on to Loomio.

**Approve minutes and track actions** - Post minutes and assign actions. Use a poll to approve minutes. 

## Member participation

**Share news (replace mailing list)** - Post information for members, invite comments.
