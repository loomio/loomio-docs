# Navigating in threads
_Find what you need, when you need it, in a thread._

## Context
The thread **context** is always at the top of the thread. Use it to frame the context for your discussion or decision. Learn more about engaging with the thread context [here](../engaging_with_threads/#thread-context).

## Timeline

The timeline helps you quickly access content in the thread such as comments, polls, decisions and outcomes. It is a visual, interactive history of key events, milestones and decision processes where you can see how a conversation evolved over time and the discussion that led to a decision.

Comments formatted with a header, proposals and polls are automatically added to the timeline as links. Click the timeline text to go directly to the thread item.

You can pin or unpin any comment to the timeline, and edit the text displayed on the timeline.  See more at [Thread admin: Pin to Timeline](../thread_admin/#pin-to-timeline).

Jump to the top of the thread by clicking on "**Context**".

## Thread layout

By default comments in threads are listed one after the other as you scroll down the thread page - oldest comments first.  However you can change the thread order so that newest comments are listed at the top of the thread.  Seeing the latest comments first is useful for threads used for reporting or threads that have been active for some time.

The grey text just under the context will indicate in which order the activity is being listed, along with the number of replies.

To change this setting, click that grey text, choose your preference, and save. _This changes the layout for everyone, not just you._

### How replies are displayed

The thread can also be set to display chronologically, as a **flat list**, where all activity is displayed in the order that it happened. _Again, this setting is for all thread members as threads are viewed in the same way by everyone._

Similar to switching oldest for newest first, change how replies are displayed by clicking the grey text under the context to first open **Thread layout** options, select your preference, and save.

## Unread activity
When you open a thread on Loomio you will first be taken to unread (or unseen) activity. When activity items are displayed on your screen, Loomio will take note that they have been read, _just like if you see the activity via an email._ Unread content is displayed with a yellow stripe on the left side and threads with unread content display bold within thread lists.

## Finding the right thread

If you're looking for a thread of the same kind, try clicking the [Category tag](../thread_admin/#category-tags) if there is one to the right of the title of the thread.

Otherwise, you can always use the [search](../../users/navigation/#search).
