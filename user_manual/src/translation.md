# Languages and Translation

Loomio supports two types of translation:
- Translation of the the user interface including the buttons and labels and messages.
- Translation of user content including Comments, Discussions, Votes etc.

Translation of the user interface is provided by a community of Loomio users, who contribute to our open source code via a tool called "Transifex".

Translation of the user content is provided by Google Translate, and done automatically when requested by users.
