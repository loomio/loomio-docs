## I've deleted my account - what does this mean?

Deleting your account will _not_ cancel your group subscription if you have one; to stop your payments see [Subscriptions](/en/subscriptions/management).

Here is our [privacy policy](https://help.loomio.com/en/policy/privacy/) - if you have any questions about our policy, you can [get in touch](https://www.loomio.org/contact) with us.

When your account is deleted, we remove all of your personal information, permanently. Comments, proposals and discussions you’ve made will remain but your name will be removed from them. We do this because we have an obligation to groups to keep threads and proposals coherent.

It is important that you understand that copies of the data you have generated on Loomio have likely been emailed to everyone in the group - Loomio has no ability to delete content that has been emailed to people, or saved in screenshots.
