# Deleting your Loomio account

## What does delete account mean?

When you delete your account:
- Your user account including your name, email address and other personally identifying data will be deleted from our systems. You will not be able to sign in to Loomio with this account.
- Comments, proposal and discussions you have made will remain but your name will be removed from them. We do this because we have an obligation to groups to keep threads and proposals coherent.
- You will no longer be listed as a member of any groups.
- You will no longer receive notification emails.

It is important to understand that copies of the data you have generated on Loomio have likely been emailed to everyone in the group - Loomio has no ability to delete those.

Deleting your account will _not_ cancel your subscription; to stop your payments see [Subscriptions](https://help.loomio.com/en/policy/subscriptions/management/#cancel-your-plan).

**Loomio takes privacy and data protection very seriously**. Here is a link to our [policy](https://www.loomio.org/privacy) - if you have any questions about our policy, you can [get in touch](https://www.loomio.com/contact) with us.
